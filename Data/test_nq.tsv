55	Food is ingested through the mouth and when swallowed passes first into the pharynx and then into the esophagus . The esophagus is thus one of the first components of the digestive system and the gastrointestinal tract . After food passes through the esophagus , it enters the stomach . When food is being swallowed , the epiglottis moves backward to cover the larynx , preventing food from entering the trachea . At the same time , the upper esophageal sphincter relaxes , allowing a bolus of food to enter . Peristaltic contractions of the esophageal muscle push the food down the esophagus . These rhythmic contractions occur both as a reflex response to food that is in the mouth , and also as a response to the sensation of food within the esophagus itself . Along with peristalsis , the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes .	what is the purpose of the muscles that line the esophagus	ask_question

60	As of 2015 -- 16 , there were still a significant number of customers who preferred the 4 - inch screen size of iPhone 5S , which remained the second-most popular iPhone after the iPhone 6 and ahead of the iPhone 6S. Apple stated in their event that they sold 30 million 4 - inch iPhones in 2015 , even as that form factor was succeeded as the flagship iPhone by the redesigned larger display 4.7 / 5.5 - inch iPhone 6 and 6 Plus back in September 2014 . Furthermore , the 5 and 5S design was regarded as `` long been the golden child of Apple phone design and a benchmark for phones in general '' ( with the 5S 's gold finish adding a premium touch to the 5 's already well - regarded look ) , while the succeeding 6 and 6S design was less critically acclaimed as it `` felt a little bit wrong , as though you were holding a slick $650 bar of soap '' .

It felt streamlined , yet substantial , which is different from iPhone 6 , which feels substantial in size alone . Plus , unlike the ubiquitous rounded corners of the 6 , iPhone 5 did n't really look like anything else on the market at the time '' .

66	The theory of the objective correlative as it relates to literature was largely developed through the writings of the poet and literary critic T.S. Eliot , who is associated with the literary group called the New Critics . Helping define the objective correlative , Eliot 's essay `` Hamlet and His Problems '' , republished in his book The Sacred Wood : Essays on Poetry and Criticism discusses his view of Shakespeare 's incomplete development of Hamlet 's emotions in the play Hamlet . Eliot uses Lady Macbeth 's state of mind as an example of the successful objective correlative : `` The artistic ' inevitability ' lies in this complete adequacy of the external to the emotion ... . '' , as a contrast to Hamlet . According to Eliot , the feelings of Hamlet are not sufficiently supported by the story and the other characters surrounding him . The objective correlative 's purpose is to express the character 's emotions by showing rather than describing feelings as discussed earlier by Plato and referred to by Peter Barry in his book Beginning Theory : An Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory as `` ... perhaps little more than the ancient distinction ( first made by Plato ) between mimesis and diegesis ... . '' ( 28 ) . According to Formalist critics , this action of creating an emotion through external factors and evidence linked together and thus forming an objective correlative should produce an author 's detachment from the depicted character and unite the emotion of the literary work . The `` occasion '' of E. Montale is a further form of correlative .	who gave the famous objective co relative theory	ask_question

95	After condensation of mass and ignition of a star , it generates thermal energy in the dense core region through nuclear fusion of hydrogen atoms into helium . During this stage of the star 's lifetime , it is located along the main sequence at a position determined primarily by its mass , but also based upon its chemical composition and other factors . All main - sequence stars are in hydrostatic equilibrium , where outward thermal pressure from the hot core is balanced by the inward pressure of gravitational collapse from the overlying layers . The strong dependence of the rate of energy generation in the core on the temperature and pressure helps to sustain this balance . Energy generated at the core makes its way to the surface and is radiated away at the photosphere . The energy is carried by either radiation or convection , with the latter occurring in regions with steeper temperature gradients , higher opacity or both .	how does a star become a main sequence	ask_question

On June 8 , 2009 , Democrats Hiram Monserrate and Pedro Espada , Jr. , joined the 30 Republican members of the State Senate to attempt to issue a motion to replace current Majority Leader Malcolm Smith with Minority Leader Dean Skelos . Following the precedent of 1913 , the temporary presidency and the majority leadership would have been separated again under this scenario . Since the office of Lieutenant Governor fell vacant after Lt. Gov. David Paterson succeeded to the governorship upon Gov. Eliot Spitzer 's resignation , the majority leaders ( Bruno , Skelos and Smith ) have acted as lieutenant governors . The motions put forward on June 8 also sought to select Pedro Espada as Temporary President of the State Senate , which would have installed him as acting lieutenant governor . The Democrats have disputed the legitimacy of the motions put forward on June 8 . The New York State Senate has been providing a running update of the legal proceedings since June 11 , 2009 . The dispute ended July 9 , 2009 , when Senator Espada announced he would return to the Democratic caucus and take on the position of majority leader , while it was also announced that former majority leader Malcolm Smith had assumed the title of president pro tempore , and John Sampson would serve as Democratic conference leader with the understanding he would assume the presidency at an undetermined future date .

155	As leader of the Yishuv , David Ben - Gurion was the first person to sign . The declaration was due to be signed by all 37 members of Moetzet HaAm . However , twelve members could not attend , eleven of them trapped in besieged Jerusalem and one abroad . The remaining 25 signatories present were called up in alphabetical order to sign , leaving spaces for those absent . Although a space was left for him between the signatures of Eliyahu Dobkin and Meir Vilner , Zerach Warhaftig signed at the top of the next column , leading to speculation that Vilner 's name had been left alone to isolate him , or to stress that even a communist agreed with the declaration . However , Warhaftig later denied this , stating that a space had been left for him ( as he was one of the signatories trapped in Jerusalem ) where a Hebraicised form of his name would have fitted alphabetically , but he insisted on signing under his actual name so as to honour his father 's memory and so moved down two spaces . He and Vilner would be the last surviving signatories , and remained close for the rest of their lives .

Chymotrypsin preferentially cleaves peptide amide bonds where the side - chain of the amino acid N - terminal to the scissile amide bond ( the P position ) is a large hydrophobic amino acid ( tyrosine , tryptophan , and phenylalanine ) . These amino acids contain an aromatic ring in their sidechain that fits into a ' hydrophobic pocket ' ( the S position ) of the enzyme . It is activated in the presence of trypsin . The hydrophobic and shape complementarity between the peptide substrate P sidechain and the enzyme S binding cavity accounts for the substrate specificity of this enzyme . Chymotrypsin also hydrolyzes other amide bonds in peptides at slower rates , particularly those containing leucine and methionine at the P position .	where does cleavage of the peptide bond by chymotrypsin occur	ask_question

180	The peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) is one of the two components of the nervous system , the other part is the central nervous system ( CNS ) . The PNS consists of the nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord . The main function of the PNS is to connect the CNS to the limbs and organs , essentially serving as a relay between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body . Unlike the CNS , the PNS is not protected by the vertebral column and skull , or by the blood -- brain barrier , which leaves it exposed to toxins and mechanical injuries . The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system . In the somatic nervous system , the cranial nerves are part of the PNS with the exception of the optic nerve ( cranial nerve II ) , along with the retina . The second cranial nerve is not a true peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon . Cranial nerve ganglia originated in the CNS . However , the remaining ten cranial nerve axons extend beyond the brain and are therefore considered part of the PNS . The autonomic nervous system is an involuntary control of smooth muscle and glands . The connection between CNS and organs allows the system to be in two different functional states : sympathetic and parasympathetic .	explain the function of the peripheral nervous system	ask_question

184	By the late 1960s `` classic rock '' period , a number of distinct rock music subgenres had emerged , including hybrids like blues rock , folk rock , country rock , raga rock , and jazz - rock , many of which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock , which was influenced by the countercultural psychedelic and hippie scene . New genres that emerged included progressive rock , which extended the artistic elements ; glam rock , which highlighted showmanship and visual style ; and the diverse and enduring subgenre of heavy metal , which emphasized volume , power , and speed . In the second half of the 1970s , punk rock reacted by producing stripped - down , energetic social and political critiques .

187	The dynasty was founded by the Jurchen Aisin Gioro clan in Manchuria . In the late sixteenth century , Nurhaci , originally a Ming vassal , began organizing `` Banners '' , military - social units that included Jurchen , Han Chinese , and Mongol elements . Nurhaci formed the Jurchen clans into a unified entity , which he renamed as the Manchus . By 1636 , his son Hong Taiji began driving Ming forces out of Liaodong and declared a new dynasty , the Qing . In 1644 , peasant rebels led by Li Zicheng conquered the Ming capital , Beijing . Rather than serve them , Ming general Wu Sangui made an alliance with the Manchus and opened the Shanhai Pass to the Banner Armies led by the regent Prince Dorgon , who defeated the rebels and seized the capital . Resistance from the Southern Ming and the Revolt of the Three Feudatories led by Wu Sangui extended the conquest of China proper for nearly four decades and was not completed until 1683 under the Kangxi Emperor ( r . 1661 -- 1722 ) .

They are responsible for color vision and function best in relatively bright light , as opposed to rod cells , which work better in dim light . Cone cells are densely packed in the fovea centralis , a 0.3 mm diameter rod - free area with very thin , densely packed cones which quickly reduce in number towards the periphery of the retina . There are about six to seven million cones in a human eye and are most concentrated towards the macula . The commonly cited figure of six million cone cells in the human eye was found by Osterberg in 1935 . Oyster 's textbook ( 1999 ) cites work by Curcio et al.

217	The Sun is about halfway through its main - sequence stage , during which nuclear fusion reactions in its core fuse hydrogen into helium . Each second , more than four million tonnes of matter are converted into energy within the Sun 's core , producing neutrinos and solar radiation . At this rate , the Sun has so far converted around 100 times the mass of Earth into energy , about 0.03 % of the total mass of the Sun . The Sun will spend a total of approximately 10 billion years as a main - sequence star . The Sun is gradually becoming hotter during its time on the main sequence , because the helium atoms in the core occupy less volume than the hydrogen atoms that were fused . The core is therefore shrinking , allowing the outer layers of the Sun to move closer to the centre and experience a stronger gravitational force , according to the inverse - square law . This stronger force increases the pressure on the core , which is resisted by a gradual increase in the rate at which fusion occurs . This process speeds up as the core gradually becomes denser . It is estimated that the Sun has become 30 % brighter in the last 4.5 billion years . At present , it is increasing in brightness by about 1 % every 100 million years .	what stage of the star life cycle is the sun in	ask_question

For seventeen years , she has been under the care of Viserys , whom she fears , as he is abusive to her whenever she displeases him . In exchange for an army , Viserys marries her to the powerful Dothraki warlord Khal Drogo , making her a Khaleesi , a queen of the Dothraki . Daenerys is at first afraid of her new husband but after learning the Dothraki language , she manages to get past their barriers . She begins to understand him and genuinely falls in love with him after learning Drogo is an intelligent leader and a kind man . After embracing the Dothraki culture , she becomes stronger and rebels against her brother . She later becomes pregnant with Drogo 's son who is prophesied by the Dothraki to be the `` Stallion Who Mounts the World '' . After her brother 's death and an assassination attempt by Robert Baratheon , Drogo vows to Daenerys that he will conquer the Seven Kingdoms for her and their unborn son . However , during their journey Drogo suffers from blood poisoning due to an infected wound incurred during a fight with a Dothraki tribesman . Daenerys is forced to seek the help of healer Mirri Maz Duur to save his life using blood magic . Mirri tricks Daenerys by using her unborn son 's life as a sacrifice to heal Drogo , leaving him in a permanent catatonic state , and forcing Daenerys to end her husband 's life . Losing both her husband and son , Daenerys punishes Mirri by having her burnt at the stake . She also lays the three dragon eggs she received as a wedding gift onto Khal Drogo 's body , then steps into the burning funeral pyre . After the fire extinguishes itself , the Khaleesi and three baby dragons , named Drogon , Rhaegal , and Viserion , are found alive and unharmed . Daenerys takes the baby dragons and the remaining tribe to gather new allies and reclaim the Iron Throne . She becomes the first female Dothraki leader . In Season 2 , she is lost in the Red Waste , a stretch of barren land . She and her khalasar eventually make it to Qarth , where the nobles are more interested in her dragons than her conquering Westeros .

In the second season 's finale , she imprisons her host Xaro Xoan Daxos for having helped Pyat Pree . Her horde loot Xaro 's mansion to buy a ship . Daenerys travels from Qarth to Astapor , a city in Slaver 's Bay , where she negotiates the purchase of elite eunuch soldiers called the Unsullied . She also meets the famed knight Ser Barristan Selmy , and accepts him into her queensguard . On her departure from the city , she frees the slaves and has Drogon torch its elders . By the end of Season 3 , although her power has not yet been tested , she has acquired the loyalty of tens of thousands of freed slaves from Astapor and Yunkai , her remaining Dothraki brethren ( and two former Westerosi soldiers whom she encountered through the Dothraki , who advise her ) 2,000 ' Second Sons ' cavalrymen , 8,000 ' Unsullied ' elite infantry , and three rapidly growing dragons . The stay in Slaver 's Bay has made her question her motives , however , and she takes up the cause of ending slavery as well , donning the honorific `` Breaker of Chains '' as the slaves hold her to the sky , praising her as their Mhysa , or `` Mother '' . Daenerys later frees the slaves from Meereen , the last of the slave cities in Slaver 's Bay , but realizes that she is slowly losing control of her dragons , especially when Drogon shows signs of aggression towards her when she tries to break up a fight between them over food . Aware that she does not have enough men to conquer Westeros just yet , Daenerys resolves to remain in Slaver 's Bay and rule as Queen for the time being . She eventually learns of Jorah 's original purpose , which was to spy on her for Robert Baratheon , and orders him to leave Meereen on threat of execution . After she receives too many complaints about her dragons , Daenerys , locks Rhaegal and Viserion of them in the catacombs beneath Meereen before searching for Drogon . Meanwhile , Daenerys faces a new threat to her rule in the form of the Sons of the Harpy , a resistance movement against her and the Unsullied . She considers freeing her dragons , but they attempt to attack her , making her realize that they are no longer loyal to her . After Daario and Grey Worm arrest a member of the Sons of the Harpy , Mossador implores Daenerys to execute their captive , but Barristan tells her of the Mad King 's actions against his enemies , which included burning them with wildfire while laughing . He asks her not to execute the captive without a fair trial , and she agrees with him . Mossador goes against her wishes , and kills the captive Son of the Harpy . Daenerys has him publicly executed , which leads a riot to break out between the old masters and the freed slaves . At night , Daenerys finds that Drogon has returned , but when she tries to touch his face , he flies away . Soon afterward , a group of Unsullied patrolling the streets of Meereen are stopped by a crying woman who points them to an alleyway . The Unsullied head in to investigate , but it is revealed that the entire affair was a set up after they are soon cornered by a group of the Sons of the Harpy . The Unsullied attempt to fight back , but the Sons of the Harpy kill many of them . Barristan Selmy sees the commotion and tries to help , killing many of the Sons of the Harpy , but gets badly wounded , and dies . Grey Worm also sustains serious but nonfatal injuries . Daenerys is furious after learning what has happened to Barristan , and rounds up the leaders of the great Meereenese houses . She takes them into the catacombs where she randomly has one of them shoved forward . The Meereenese lord is promptly killed by dragonfire from Rhaegal , and he and Viserion eat him . Daenerys then has all the lords arrested , including her former adviser Hizdahr zo Loraq , whom she decides to marry to win over the Meereenese nobles . To respect the culture of the region , she agrees to have the fighting pits reinstated ( she had previously declined due to her distaste for killing for sport ) . Hizdahr convinces Daenerys to go to one of the pits to see the contestants battling over who will go to the final competition . Daenerys is sickened by the bloodshed , and gets up to leave , but her attention is turned by one masked competitor who defeats all of the other competitors without killing any of them . This competitor turns out to be Jorah Mormont , who is trying to win over Daenerys ' favor after being banished . Daenerys orders the Unsullied to take him away , but Jorah announces that he has brought her a gift , and Tyrion Lannister reveals himself to Daenerys . After a round of questioning , Daenerys banishes Jorah once again , but takes Tyrion on as her adviser . On the great opening of Daznak 's Pit , Jorah resurfaces as a voluntary contender on the arena , but Daenerys refuses to stop the games to spare his life . Jorah eventually prevails and saves her life by impaling with his spear an attacker from the Sons of the Harpy , who appear in legions and attack Daenerys ' guards . Cornered at the midst of the arena , defeat seems immediate when Drogon returns , killing many Sons of the Harpy despite being wounded by several of their spears . Daenerys manages to rekindle their bond and climbs his back , riding off into the distance to a stunned crowd . She roams the Great Steppe north of the city , where Drogon seems reluctant to obey her commands or even hunt for food . Strolling about on her own , Daenerys is faced with an incoming Dothraki khalasar of great numbers , and after dropping a ring to the ground to leave a trail , she is surrounded . In season 6 , the Dothraki take her to Vaes Dothrak , where she identifies herself to Khal Moro as Drogo 's former wife . Out of respect for Dothraki traditions , they take Daenerys to join the Dosh Khaleen , which consisted of the wives of deceased khals . Daenerys refuses and instead burns the temple down with herself and all the khals still inside . She emerges unscathed , and the awed Dothraki accept her as their new leader . She returns to Meereen with her new army and destroys the slaver fleet assaulting the city with her dragons . In the aftermath , Daenerys meets with Theon and Yara Greyjoy , who offer their support for her claim so that they can overthrow their uncle Euron . Daenerys accepts their aid and secures help from the Reach and Dorne , names Tyrion as her hand , but breaks up with Daario , ordering him to stay behind and govern Slaver 's Bay in her absence . With her new army , Daenerys finally sets sail for Westeros . In Season 7 Daenerys finally uses her dragons in battle , annihilating a Lannister force and their baggage train with fire . Daenerys welcomes Jon Snow to Dragonstone , seeing him as a friend and ally , insisting that he bend the knee to her but exhibiting patience with his refusal . She believes his tales of white walkers and agrees to let him mine dragonglass ( obsidian ) from her land . When Jon 's expedition north of the Wall gets into trouble Daenerys takes her dragons to rescue them , and is devastated when the Night King kills one . On the ship back to Dragonstone she and Jon make love .	who plays the dragon queen from game of thrones	ask_question

314	In biology , a species is the basic unit of classification and a taxonomic rank , as well as a unit of biodiversity , but it has proven difficult to find a satisfactory definition . Scientists and conservationists need a species definition which allows them to work , regardless of the theoretical difficulties . If as Linnaeus thought , species were fixed , there would be no problem , but evolutionary processes cause species to change continually , and to grade into one another . A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring , typically by sexual reproduction . While this definition is often adequate , when looked at more closely it is problematic . For example , with hybridisation , in a species complex of hundreds of similar microspecies , or in a ring species , the boundaries between closely related species become unclear . Among organisms that reproduce only asexually , the concept of a reproductive species breaks down , and each clone is potentially a microspecies . Problems also arise when dealing with fossils , since reproduction can not be examined ; the concept of the chronospecies is therefore used in palaeontology . Other ways of defining species include their karyotype , DNA sequence , morphology , behaviour or ecological niche .	when are organisms considered to belong to the same species	ask_question
315	In 1716 , the Spanish government established several Roman Catholic missions in East Texas . The isolation of the missions -- the nearest Spanish settlement , San Juan Bautista , Coahuila was over 400 miles ( 644 km ) away -- made it difficult to keep them adequately provisioned . To assist the missionaries , the new governor of Spanish Texas , Martín de Alarcón , wished to establish a way station between the settlements along the Rio Grande and the new missions in East Texas . In April 1718 , Alarcón led an expedition to found a new community in Texas . On May 1 , the group erected a temporary mud , brush , and straw structure near the headwaters of the San Antonio River . This building would serve as a new mission , San Antonio de Valero , named after Saint Anthony of Padua and the viceroy of New Spain , Baltasar de Zúñiga y Guzmán Sotomayor y Sarmiento , Marquess of Valero . The mission , headed by Father Antonio de San Buenaventura y Olivares , was located near a community of Coahuiltecans and was initially populated by three to five Indian converts from Mission San Francisco Solano near San Juan Bautista .

318	Although the electric chair has long been a symbol of the death penalty in the United States , its use is in decline due to the rise of lethal injection , which is widely believed to be a more humane method of execution . Although some states still maintain electrocution as a method of execution , today , it is only maintained as a secondary method that may be chosen over lethal injection at the request of the prisoner , except in Tennessee , where it may be used if the drugs for lethal injection are not available , without input from the prisoner . As of 2014 , electrocution is an optional form of execution in Alabama , Florida , South Carolina , and Virginia . They allow the prisoner to choose lethal injection as an alternative method . In the state of Kentucky , the electric chair has been retired , except for those whose capital crimes were committed prior to March 31 , 1998 , and who choose electrocution ; inmates who do not choose electrocution and inmates who committed their crimes after the designated date are executed by lethal injection . In the state of Tennessee , the electric chair is available for use if lethal injection drugs are unavailable , or otherwise , if the inmate so chooses and if their capital crime was committed before 1999 . The electric chair is an alternate form of execution approved for potential use in Arkansas and Oklahoma if other forms of execution are found unconstitutional in the state at the time of execution . On February 8 , 2008 , the Nebraska Supreme Court determined that execution by electric chair was a `` cruel and unusual punishment '' under the state 's constitution . This brought executions of this type to an end in Nebraska , the only remaining state to retain electrocution as its sole method of execution .	when did they stop using the electric chair in america	ask_question
319	The Prisoners ( Temporary Discharge for Ill Health ) Act , commonly referred to as the Cat and Mouse Act , was an Act of Parliament passed in Britain under Herbert Henry Asquith 's Liberal government in 1913 . Some members of the Women 's Social and Political Union ( WSPU , commonly referred to as suffragettes ) had been imprisoned for acts of vandalism in support of women 's suffrage . In protest to being imprisoned some of these suffragettes undertook hunger strikes . These suffragettes were then force - fed leading to a public outcry . This act was a response to the outcry ; it allowed the prisoners to be released on licence as soon as the hunger strike affected their health . They then had a period of time in which they could recover . After a predetermined period of time the prisoner would be rearrested to serve out the rest of their sentence . Conditions could be placed on the prisoner during the time of their release . The hunger strikes themselves were now technically legal . However , the Act allowed for the re-imprisonment of the hunger strikers upon their recovery on their original charges .

Class A airspace extends from 18,000 feet above mean sea level to flight level 600 ( 60,000 feet pressure altitude ) above the contiguous 48 United States and overlying the waters within 12 miles thereof . Flight in Class A airspace requires pilots and aircraft to be instrument equipped and rated and to be operating under Instrument Flight Rules ( IFR ) . In many countries commercial airliners and their pilots must operate under IFR as the majority of flights enter Class A airspace ; however , aircraft operating as commercial airliners must operate under IFR even if the flight plan does not take the craft into Class A airspace , such as with smaller regional flights . Procedures and training are significantly more complex compared to VFR instruction , as a pilot must demonstrate competency in conducting an entire cross-country flight solely by reference to instruments .	when is a pilot on an ifr flight plan responsible for avoiding other aircraft	ask_question

338	These rings are typically made of yellow or white gold with diamonds . They usually include the team name , team logo , and Super Bowl number ( usually indicated in Roman numerals ) . The NFL contributes up to $5,000 per ring for up to 150 rings for o the winning team ; any additional costs are borne by the team . Most rings are manufactured by memorabilia company Jostens . In 2015 , the rings for the New England Patriots reportedly cost $36,500 each , making them the most expensive rings Jostens has ever produced . The winning team can typically present rings to whomever they choose , including usually , but not limited to : players ( active roster or injured ) , coaches , trainers , executives , personnel , and general staff . Some teams have given rings to former players and coaches that were on the team at some point during the season , despite not having been on the winning roster for the Super Bowl itself . Sometimes a team will give rings to fans as part of a charity raffle . Teams can distribute any number of rings . A recent trend over the last 15 -- 20 years has been lesser rings awarded to front office staff . These are commonly called `` B '' and `` C '' level rings and are smaller and contain fewer diamonds or contain faux diamonds . The first instance of this was the Redskins Super Bowl XVII ring when many in the front office received rings that were not solid gold and contained cubic zirconia stones ( which resemble diamonds ) . When Tampa Bay won Super Bowl XXXVII , the players and coaches received rings with a diamond - centered Lombardi trophy . Some staff received rings with a metal Lombardi trophy and real diamonds surrounding the trophy and the `` C '' level ring did not contain any diamonds .	what nfl team has the most expensive super bowl ring	ask_question

341	The American entry into World War I came in April 1917 , after more than two and a half years of efforts by President Woodrow Wilson to keep the United States out of the war . Apart from an Anglophile element urging early support for the British , American public opinion reflected that of the president : the sentiment for neutrality was particularly strong among Irish Americans , German Americans and Scandinavian Americans , as well as among church leaders and among women in general . On the other hand , even before World War I had broken out , American opinion had been more negative toward Germany than towards any other country in Europe . Over time , especially after reports of atrocities in Belgium in 1914 and following the sinking of the passenger liner RMS Lusitania in 1915 , the American citizens increasingly came to see Germany as the aggressor in Europe .	when did the usa join world war one	ask_question

346	The Peloponnesian War ( 431 -- 404 BC ) was an ancient Greek war fought by the Delian League led by Athens against the Peloponnesian League led by Sparta . Historians have traditionally divided the war into three phases . In the first phase , the Archidamian War , Sparta launched repeated invasions of Attica , while Athens took advantage of its naval supremacy to raid the coast of the Peloponnese and attempt to suppress signs of unrest in its empire . This period of the war was concluded in 421 BC , with the signing of the Peace of Nicias . That treaty , however , was soon undermined by renewed fighting in the Peloponnese . In 415 BC , Athens dispatched a massive expeditionary force to attack Syracuse in Sicily ; the attack failed disastrously , with the destruction of the entire force , in 413 BC . This ushered in the final phase of the war , generally referred to either as the Decelean War , or the Ionian War . In this phase , Sparta , now receiving support from Persia , supported rebellions in Athens ' subject states in the Aegean Sea and Ionia , undermining Athens ' empire , and , eventually , depriving the city of naval supremacy . The destruction of Athens ' fleet at Aegospotami effectively ended the war , and Athens surrendered in the following year .

349	In 1989 , the Hawke Labor Government began gradually re-introducing fees for university study . It set up the Higher Education Contributions Scheme ( HECS ) , which was first proposed by Professor Murray Wells and subsequently developed by economist and lecturer at the Australian National University , Bruce Chapman and championed by Education Minister John Dawkins ( see Dawkins Revolution ) . Under the original HECS , a $1,800 fee was charged to all university students , and the Commonwealth paid the balance . A student could defer payment of this HECS amount ( in which case it was called a HECS debt ) and repay the debt through the tax system , when the student 's income exceeds a threshold level .

358	The Dust Bowl , also known as the Dirty Thirties , was a period of severe dust storms that greatly damaged the ecology and agriculture of the American and Canadian prairies during the 1930s ; severe drought and a failure to apply dryland farming methods to prevent wind erosion ( the Aeolian processes ) caused the phenomenon . The drought came in three waves , 1934 , 1936 , and 1939 -- 1940 , but some regions of the high plains experienced drought conditions for as many as eight years . With insufficient understanding of the ecology of the plains , farmers had conducted extensive deep plowing of the virgin topsoil of the Great Plains during the previous decade ; this had displaced the native , deep - rooted grasses that normally trapped soil and moisture even during periods of drought and high winds . The rapid mechanization of farm equipment , especially small gasoline tractors , and widespread use of the combine harvester contributed to farmers ' decisions to convert arid grassland ( much of which received no more than 10 inches ( 250 mm ) of precipitation per year ) to cultivated cropland .	when did the dust bowl end in oklahoma	ask_question

366	The 1824 presidential election marked the final collapse of the Republican - Federalist political framework . Considering the large numbers of candidates and strong regional preferences , it is not surprising that the results of the election of 1824 were inconclusive . The electoral map confirmed the candidates ' sectional support , with Adams winning outright in the New England states , Jackson gleaning success in states throughout the nation , Clay attracting votes from the West , and Crawford attracting votes from the eastern South . Andrew Jackson received more electoral and popular votes than any other candidate , but not the majority of 131 electoral votes needed to win the election . Since no candidate received the required majority of electoral votes , the presidential election was decided by the House of Representatives ( see `` Contingent election '' below ) . Meanwhile , John C. Calhoun easily defeated his rivals in the race for the vice presidency , as the support of both the Adams and Jackson camps quickly gave him an unassailable lead over the other candidates . This means that 1824 marks the only election in U.S. history where only the vice presidential candidate had been successfully elected to an executive office by Electoral College . Despite Clay himself finishing last in the electoral college , his running - mate , Nathan Sanford actually finished second behind Calhoun in the vice presidential vote , mostly because nearly half of the electors pledged to Crawford voted for candidates other than his designated running - mate , Nathaniel Macon , with New York senator Martin Van Buren being the main beneficiary .	who received the most (but not a majority of) electoral votes in 1824	ask_question
367	In the Romantic period , music became more expressive and emotional , expanding to encompass literary , artistic , and philosophical themes . Famous early Romantic composers include Beethoven ( whose works span both this period and the preceding Classical period ) , Schubert , Schumann , Chopin , Mendelssohn , Bellini , and Berlioz . The late 19th century saw a dramatic expansion in the size of the orchestra and in the dynamic range and diversity of instruments used in this ensemble . Also , public concerts became a key part of urban middle class society , in contrast to earlier periods , when concerts were mainly paid for by and performed for aristocrats . Famous composers from the second half of the century include Bruckner , Johann Strauss II , Brahms , Liszt , Tchaikovsky , Dvořák , Verdi , and Wagner . Between 1890 and 1910 , a third wave of composers including Mahler , Richard Strauss , Puccini , and Sibelius built on the work of middle Romantic composers to create even more complex -- and often much longer -- musical works . A prominent mark of late 19th century music is its nationalistic fervor , as exemplified by such figures as Dvořák , Sibelius , and Grieg .

375	James Long believed that the British mercantile community and even the Government unjustly and oppressively treated the Indigo cultivators . His view concurred with Dinabandhu Mitra who expressed his sentiments in a play entitled Nil Darpan ( the original Bengali play was written by him ) and published anonymously from Dhaka in 1860 . Mitra sent Long a copy of the play as early as 1861 . Long brought it to the notice of W. S Seton - Karr , Secretary to the Governor of Bengal and ex-President of the Indigo Commission . Seton - Karr , sensing its importance , mentioned Nil Durpan in conversation with the Lieutenant Governor , Grant. Grant expressed a wish to see a translation of it and print a few copies to be circulated privately amongst friends . After the discussion , Seton - Karr asked Long to arrange for a translation of the play in English . Michael Madhusudan Dutta translated it under the supervision of Long . Long as the editor cut out some coarse passages and wrote a short prefatory note for the play . When the translation was complete , Seton - Karr ordered printing of five hundred copies in lieu of Grant 's wish of a few copies . Then Long sent the translated manuscripts to Clement Henry Manuel , the proprietor of the Calcutta Printing and Publishing Press to print five hundred copies and the cost came to around Rs. 300 . It was published in April or May 1861 . Unknown to the Lieutenant Governor , Long began sending out the copies in official Government envelopes that had the heading : `` on her Majesty 's Service '' . The translation revealed the nature of the oppression against the indigo planters . It naturally offended the establishment of the play so much that a razing propaganda was started by the Anglo - Indian Press against the publisher and the translator . One of the leading newspapers named The Englishmen and some indigo planters instituted a libel suit against Long and the printer - C.H. Manuel . The words mentioned in Long 's Introduction to the play stated that what was presented in it was `` plain but true '' . This was subsequently used by the planters in their prosecution of Long for publishing defamatory statements .	who translated the play neel darpan into english	ask_question
376	Combustion / kəmˈbʌs. tʃ ən / or burning is a high - temperature exothermic redox chemical reaction between a fuel ( the reductant ) and an oxidant , usually atmospheric oxygen , that produces oxidized , often gaseous products , in a mixture termed as smoke . Combustion in a fire produces a flame , and the heat produced can make combustion self - sustaining . Combustion is often a complicated sequence of elementary radical reactions . Solid fuels , such as wood and coal , first undergo endothermic pyrolysis to produce gaseous fuels whose combustion then supplies the heat required to produce more of them . Combustion is often hot enough that light in the form of either glowing or a flame is produced . A simple example can be seen in the combustion of hydrogen and oxygen into water vapor , a reaction commonly used to fuel rocket engines .

389	Although the month and date of Jesus ' birth are unknown , by the early - to - mid fourth century the Western Christian Church had placed Christmas on December 25 , a date that was later adopted in the East .

However , some Eastern Christian Churches celebrate Christmas on December 25 of the older Julian calendar , which currently corresponds to January 7 in the Gregorian calendar , the day after the Western Christian Church celebrates the Epiphany . This is not a disagreement over the date of Christmas as such , but rather a preference of which calendar should be used to determine the day that is December 25 .

393	Cooling towers originated in the 19th century through the development of condensers for use with the steam engine . Condensers use relatively cool water , via various means , to condense the steam coming out of the cylinders or turbines . This reduces the back pressure , which in turn reduces the steam consumption , and thus the fuel consumption , while at the same time increasing power and recycling boiler - water . However the condensers require an ample supply of cooling water , without which they are impractical . The consumption of cooling water by inland processing and power plants is estimated to reduce power availability for the majority of thermal power plants by 2040 -- 2069 . While water usage is not an issue with marine engines , it forms a significant limitation for many land - based systems .	why does cooling water run through the condenser	ask_question
394	Chromosomes are normally visible under a light microscope only when the cell is undergoing the metaphase of cell division ( where all chromosomes are aligned in the center of the cell in their condensed form ) .

446	Initial growth of text messaging was slow , with customers in 1995 sending on average only 0.4 message per GSM customer per month . One factor in the slow take - up of SMS was that operators were slow to set up charging systems , especially for prepaid subscribers , and to eliminate billing fraud , which was possible by changing SMSC settings on individual handsets to use the SMSCs of other operators . Over time , this issue was eliminated by switch - billing instead of billing at the SMSC and by new features within SMSCs to allow blocking of foreign mobile users sending messages through it . SMS is available on a wide range of networks , including 3G networks . However , not all text - messaging systems use SMS ; some notable alternate implementations of the concept include J - Phone 's SkyMail and NTT Docomo 's Short Mail , both in Japan . E-mail messaging from phones , as popularized by NTT Docomo 's i - mode and the RIM BlackBerry , also typically use standard mail protocols such as SMTP over TCP / IP . As of 2007 text messaging was the most widely used mobile data service , with 74 % of all mobile phone users worldwide , or 2.4 billion out of 3.3 billion phone subscribers , at the end of 2007 being active users of the Short Message Service .

451	The Bantu Education Act , 1953 ( Act No. 47 of 1953 ; later renamed the Black Education Act , 1953 ) was a South African segregation law which legalised several aspects of the apartheid system . Its major provision was enforcing racially separated educational facilities . Even universities were made `` tribal '' , and all but three missionary schools chose to close down when the government no longer would help support their schools . Very few authorities continued using their own finances to support education for native Africans . In 1959 , this type of education was extended to `` non white '' universities and colleges with the Extension of University Education Act , and the internationally prestigious University College of Fort Hare was taken over by the government and degraded to being part of the Bantu education system .

488	Principal photography began on October 6 , 1975 in Lake Powell . A rift between Eastwood and Kaufman developed during the filming . Kaufman insisted on filming with a meticulous attention to detail , which caused disagreements with Eastwood , not to mention the attraction the two shared towards Locke and apparent jealousy on Kaufman 's part in regards to their emerging relationship . One evening , Kaufman insisted on finding a beer can as a prop to be used in a scene , but while he was absent , Eastwood ordered Surtees to quickly shoot the scene as light was fading and then drove away , leaving before Kaufman had returned . Soon after , filming moved to Kanab , Utah . On October 24 , 1975 , Kaufman was fired at Eastwood 's command by producer Bob Daley . The sacking caused an outrage amongst the Directors Guild of America and other important Hollywood executives , since the director had already worked hard on the film , including completing all of the pre-production . Pressure mounted on Warner Bros. and Eastwood to back down , but their refusal to do so resulted in a fine , reported to be around $60,000 for the violation . This resulted in the Director 's Guild passing new legislation , known as ' the Eastwood Rule ' , which prohibits an actor or producer from firing the director and then becoming the director himself . From then on , the film was directed by Eastwood himself with Daley second - in - command , but with Kaufman 's planning already in place , the team were able to finish making the film efficiently .	where was the outlaw of josey wales filmed	ask_question

490	As long as species have been evolving , species have been going extinct . It is estimated that over 99.9 % of all species that ever lived are extinct . The average lifespan of a species is 1 -- 10 million years , although this varies widely between taxa . There are a variety of causes that can contribute directly or indirectly to the extinction of a species or group of species . `` Just as each species is unique '' , write Beverly and Stephen C. Stearns , `` so is each extinction ... the causes for each are varied -- some subtle and complex , others obvious and simple '' . Most simply , any species that can not survive and reproduce in its environment and can not move to a new environment where it can do so , dies out and becomes extinct . Extinction of a species may come suddenly when an otherwise healthy species is wiped out completely , as when toxic pollution renders its entire habitat unliveable ; or may occur gradually over thousands or millions of years , such as when a species gradually loses out in competition for food to better adapted competitors . Extinction may occur a long time after the events that set it in motion , a phenomenon known as extinction debt .	what is the most important reason that species are going extinct	ask_question

This makes them somewhat stronger than a van der Waals interaction , and weaker than covalent or ionic bonds . This type of bond can occur in inorganic molecules such as water and in organic molecules like DNA and proteins .	other than water what else has hydrogen bonds	ask_question
496	Blond hair can have almost any proportion of pheomelanin and eumelanin , but has only small amounts of both . More pheomelanin creates a more golden or strawberry blond color , and more eumelanin creates an ash or sandy blond color . Many children born with blond hair develop darker hair as they age , with the majority of natural blonds developing a hair color of a dark blond hue by the time they reach middle age . Pregnancy hormones hasten this process . Natural light blond hair is rare in adulthood , with claims of the world 's population ranging from 2 % naturally blond to 16 % in the US . Blond hair is most commonly found in Northern and Western Europeans and their descendants but can be found spread around most of Europe . Studies in 2012 showed that naturally blond hair of Melanesians is caused by a recessive mutation in tyrosinase - related protein 1 ( TYRP1 ) .

513	The Whigs were a political faction and then a political party in the parliaments of England , Scotland , Great Britain , Ireland and the United Kingdom . Between the 1680s and 1850s , they contested power with their rivals , the Tories . The Whigs ' origin lay in constitutional monarchism and opposition to absolute monarchy . The Whigs played a central role in the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and were the standing enemies of the Stuart kings and pretenders , who were Roman Catholic . The Whigs took full control of the government in 1715 and remained totally dominant until King George III , coming to the throne in 1760 , allowed Tories back in . The `` Whig Supremacy '' ( 1715 -- 1760 ) was enabled by the Hanoverian succession of George I in 1714 and the failed Jacobite rising of 1715 by Tory rebels . The Whigs thoroughly purged the Tories from all major positions in government , the army , the Church of England , the legal profession and local offices . The Party 's hold on power was so strong and durable , historians call the period from roughly 1714 to 1783 the age of the `` Whig Oligarchy '' .

526	The Cylinder 's text has traditionally been seen by biblical scholars as corroborative evidence of Cyrus ' policy of the repatriation of the Jewish people following their Babylonian captivity ( an act that the Book of Ezra attributes to Cyrus ) , as the text refers to the restoration of cult sanctuaries and repatriation of deported peoples . This interpretation has been disputed , as the text identifies only Mesopotamian sanctuaries , and makes no mention of Jews , Jerusalem , or Judea . The Cylinder has also been referred to by Mohammad Reza Pahlavi , the last Shah of Iran as the first declaration of universal human rights , a view rejected by some historians as anachronistic and a misunderstanding of the Cylinder 's generic nature as a typical statement made by a new monarch at the beginning of his reign . Neil MacGregor , Director of the British Museum , has stated that the cylinder was `` the first attempt we know about running a society , a state with different nationalities and faiths -- a new kind of statecraft . '' It was adopted as a national symbol of Iran by the Imperial State which put it on display in Tehran in 1971 to commemorate 2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire .

527	It is also known as an `` immediate hemolytic transfusion reaction '' . This is a medical emergency as it results from rapid destruction of the donor red blood cells by host antibodies ( IgG , IgM ) .

Properdin then binds to complement C3 in the donor blood , facilitating the reaction through the alternate pathway cascade . The donor cells also become coated with IgG and are subsequently removed by macrophages in the reticuloendothelial system ( RES ) .

532	Because the states were preexisting political entities , the U.S. Constitution did not need to define or explain federalism in any one section but it often mentions the rights and responsibilities of state governments and state officials in relation to the federal government . The federal government has certain express powers ( also called enumerated powers ) which are powers spelled out in the Constitution , including the right to levy taxes , declare war , and regulate interstate and foreign commerce . In addition , the Necessary and Proper Clause gives the federal government the implied power to pass any law `` necessary and proper '' for the execution of its express powers . Other powers -- the reserved powers -- are reserved to the people or the states . The power delegated to the federal government was significantly expanded by the Supreme Court decision in McCulloch v. Maryland ( 1819 ) , amendments to the Constitution following the Civil War , and by some later amendments -- as well as the overall claim of the Civil War , that the states were legally subject to the final dictates of the federal government .	where in the constitution is the concept of federalism established	ask_question

535	The earliest predecessors of the eye were photoreceptor proteins that sense light , found even in unicellular organisms , called `` eyespots '' . Eyespots can only sense ambient brightness : they can distinguish light from dark , sufficient for photoperiodism and daily synchronization of circadian rhythms . They are insufficient for vision , as they can not distinguish shapes or determine the direction light is coming from . Eyespots are found in nearly all major animal groups , and are common among unicellular organisms , including euglena . The euglena 's eyespot , called a stigma , is located at its anterior end . It is a small splotch of red pigment which shades a collection of light sensitive crystals . Together with the leading flagellum , the eyespot allows the organism to move in response to light , often toward the light to assist in photosynthesis , and to predict day and night , the primary function of circadian rhythms . Visual pigments are located in the brains of more complex organisms , and are thought to have a role in synchronising spawning with lunar cycles . By detecting the subtle changes in night - time illumination , organisms could synchronise the release of sperm and eggs to maximise the probability of fertilisation .	what is the first step in the evolution of the eye	ask_question

572	Brain tissue consumes a large amount of energy in proportion to its volume , so large brains place severe metabolic demands on animals . The need to limit body weight in order , for example , to fly , has apparently led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species , such as bats . Most of the brain 's energy consumption goes into sustaining the electric charge ( membrane potential ) of neurons . Most vertebrate species devote between 2 % and 8 % of basal metabolism to the brain . In primates , however , the percentage is much higher -- in humans it rises to 20 -- 25 % . The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time , but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions ; this forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods PET , fMRI , and NIRS . The brain typically gets most of its energy from oxygen - dependent metabolism of glucose ( i.e. , blood sugar ) , but ketones provide a major alternative source , together with contributions from medium chain fatty acids ( caprylic and heptanoic acids ) , lactate , acetate , and possibly amino acids .	where does the brain get its energy from	ask_question

589	The Compromise of 1877 was an informal , unwritten deal that settled the intensely disputed 1876 U.S. presidential election . It resulted in the United States federal government pulling the last troops out of the South , and formally ended the Reconstruction Era . Through the Compromise , Republican Rutherford B. Hayes was awarded the White House over Democrat Samuel J. Tilden on the understanding that Hayes would remove the federal troops whose support was essential for the survival of Republican state governments in South Carolina , Florida and Louisiana .

604	As a technique for drawing , the closest predecesor to the pencil was Silverpoint until in 1565 ( some sources say as early as 1500 ) , a large deposit of graphite was discovered on the approach to Grey Knotts from the hamlet of Seathwaite in Borrowdale parish , Cumbria , England . This particular deposit of graphite was extremely pure and solid , and it could easily be sawn into sticks . It remains the only large - scale deposit of graphite ever found in this solid form . Chemistry was in its infancy and the substance was thought to be a form of lead . Consequently , it was called plumbago ( Latin for `` lead ore '' ) . Because the pencil core is still referred to as `` lead '' , or a `` lead '' , many people have the misconception that the graphite in the pencil is lead , and the black core of pencils is still referred to as lead , even though it never contained the element lead . The words for pencil in German ( bleistift ) , Irish ( peann luaidhe ) , Arabic ( قلم رصاص qalam raṣāṣ ) , and some other languages literally mean lead pen .	when did they replace lead with graphite in pencils	ask_question
605	Within eukaryotic cells , DNA is organized into long structures called chromosomes . During cell division these chromosomes are duplicated in the process of DNA replication , providing each cell its own complete set of chromosomes . Eukaryotic organisms ( animals , plants , fungi and protists ) store most of their DNA inside the cell nucleus and some of their DNA in organelles , such as mitochondria or chloroplasts . In contrast prokaryotes ( bacteria and archaea ) store their DNA only in the cytoplasm . Within the eukaryotic chromosomes , chromatin proteins such as histones compact and organize DNA . These compact structures guide the interactions between DNA and other proteins , helping control which parts of the DNA are transcribed .	where can you find dna in the body	ask_question

618	Transcription occurs in the cell nucleus , where the DNA is held . The DNA structure of the cell is made up of two helixes made up of sugar and phosphate held together by hydrogen bonds between the bases of opposite strands . The sugar and the phosphate in each strand are joined together by stronger phosphodiester covalent bonds . The DNA is `` unzipped '' ( disruption of hydrogen bonds between different single strands ) by the enzyme helicase , leaving the single nucleotide chain open to be copied . RNA polymerase reads the DNA strand from the 3 - prime ( 3 ' ) end to the 5 - prime ( 5 ' ) end , while it synthesizes a single strand of messenger RNA in the 5 ' - to - 3 ' direction . The general RNA structure is very similar to the DNA structure , but in RNA the nucleotide uracil takes the place that thymine occupies in DNA .

627	In 1910 , in conjunction with advocacy work led by Florence Kelley of the National Consumer League , the Women 's Trade Union League ( WTLU ) of Massachusetts under the leadership of Elizabeth Evans took up the cause of minimum wage legislation in Massachusetts . Over the next two years , a coalition of social reform groups and labor advocates in Boston pushed for minimum wage legislation in the state . In 1912 , Massachusetts passed the first American minimum wage legislation , which established a state commission for recommending non-compulsory minimum wages for women and children . Within eight years , at least thirteen U.S. states and the District of Columbia would pass minimum wage laws , with pressure being placed on state legislatures by the National Consumers League in a coalition with other women 's voluntary associations and organized labor . The United States Supreme Court of the Lochner era consistently invalidated compulsory minimum wage laws . Advocates for these minimum wage laws hoped that they would be upheld under the precedent of Muller v. Oregon , which upheld maximum working hours laws for women on the grounds that women required special protection that men did not . However , the Court did not extend this principle to minimum wage laws , considering the latter as interfering with the ability of employers to freely negotiate wage contracts with employees .	when was the minimum wage established in the united states	ask_question

677	It was suggested that the interior of the 45 metre ( 147 ft ) wide dome should be covered with a mosaic decoration to make the most of the available light coming through the circular windows of the drum and through the lantern . Brunelleschi had proposed the vault to glimmer with resplendent gold , but his death in 1446 put an end to this project , and the walls of the dome were whitewashed . Grand Duke Cosimo I de ' Medici decided to have the dome painted with a representation of The Last Judgment . This enormous work , 3,600 metres2 ( 38 750 ft2 ) of painted surface , was started in 1568 by Giorgio Vasari and Federico Zuccari and would last till 1579 . The upper portion , near the lantern , representing The 24 Elders of Apoc. 4 was finished by Vasari before his death in 1574 .

Grey matter is distinguished from white matter , in that it contains numerous cell bodies and relatively few myelinated axons , while white matter contains relatively few cell bodies and is composed chiefly of long - range myelinated axon tracts . The colour difference arises mainly from the whiteness of myelin . In living tissue , grey matter actually has a very light grey colour with yellowish or pinkish hues , which come from capillary blood vessels and neuronal cell bodies .	dendrites and cell bodies are components of what type of matter found in the brain	ask_question

749	The Wall Street Crash saw the total collapse of stock market values , as shareholders realized that corporations had become overpriced . They sold shares en masse , meaning meant companies found it hard to get finance . The result was that thousands of businesses were forced to close , and they laid off workers . Because workers had less money to spend , businesses received less income , leading to more closures and lay - offs . This downward spiral began the Great Depression . Berle and Means argued that under - regulation was the primary cause in their foundational book in 1932 , The Modern Corporation and Private Property . They said directors had become too unaccountable , and the markets lacked basic transparency rules . This led directly to the New Deal reforms of the Securities Act of 1933 and Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 . A new Securities and Exchange Commission was empowered to require corporations disclose all material information about their business to the investing public . Because many shareholders were physically distant from corporate headquarters where meetings would take place , new rights were made to allow people to cast votes via proxies , on the view that this and other measures would make directors more accountable . Given these reforms , a major controversy still remained about the duties that corporations also owed to employees , other stakeholders , and the rest of society . After World War Two , a general consensus emerged that directors were not bound purely to pursue `` shareholder value '' but could exercise their discretion for the good of all stakeholders , for instance by increasing wages instead of dividends , or providing services for the good of the community instead of only pursuing profits , if it was in the interests of the enterprise as a whole . However , different states had different corporate laws . To increase revenue from corporate tax , individual states had an incentive to lower their standards in a `` race to the bottom '' to attract corporations to set up their headquarters in the state , particularly where directors controlled the decision to incorporate . `` Charter competition '' , by the 1960s , had led Delaware to become home to the majority of the largest US corporations . This meant that the case law of the Delaware Chancery and Supreme Court became increasingly influential . During the 1980s , a huge takeover and merger boom decreased directors ' accountability . To fend off a takeover , courts allowed boards to institute `` poison pills '' or `` shareholder rights plans '' , which allowed directors to veto any bid -- and probably get a payout for letting a takeover happen . More and more people 's retirement savings were being invested into the stock market , through pension funds , life insurance and mutual funds . This resulted in a vast growth in the asset management industry , which tended to take control of voting rights . Both the financial sector 's share of income , and executive pay for chief executive officers began to rise far beyond real wages for the rest of the workforce . The Enron scandal of 2001 led to some reforms in the Sarbanes - Oxley Act ( on separating auditors from consultancy work ) . The global financial crisis of 2007 led to minor changes in the Dodd - Frank Act ( on soft regulation of pay , alongside derivative markets ) . However , the basic shape of corporate law in the United States has remained the same since the 1980s .	when did mandatory reporting become law in california	ask_question

754	Carnegie Hall is named after Andrew Carnegie , who funded its construction . It was intended as a venue for the Oratorio Society of New York and the New York Symphony Society , on whose boards Carnegie served . Construction began in 1890 , and was carried out by Isaac A. Hopper and Company . Although the building was in use from April 1891 , the official opening night was May 5 , with a concert conducted by maestro Walter Damrosch and great Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky . Originally known simply as `` Music Hall '' ( the words `` Music Hall founded by Andrew Carnegie '' still appear on the façade above the marquee ) , the hall was renamed Carnegie Hall in 1893 after board members of the Music Hall Company of New York ( the hall 's original governing body ) persuaded Carnegie to allow the use of his name . Several alterations were made to the building between 1893 and 1896 , including the addition of two towers of artists ' studios , and alterations to the smaller auditorium on the building 's lower level .	who conducted the opening concert at carnegie hall	ask_question
755	In a large open - air theatre , like the Theatre of Dionysus in Athens , the classical masks were able to create a sense of dread in the audience creating large scale panic , especially since they had intensely exaggerated facial features and expressions . They enabled an actor to appear and reappear in several different roles , thus preventing the audience from identifying the actor to one specific character . Their variations help the audience to distinguish sex , age , and social status , in addition to revealing a change in a particular character 's appearance , e.g. Oedipus after blinding himself . Unique masks were also created for specific characters and events in a play , such as The Furies in Aeschylus ' Eumenides and Pentheus and Cadmus in Euripides ' The Bacchae . Worn by the chorus , the masks created a sense of unity and uniformity , while representing a multi-voiced persona or single organism and simultaneously encouraged interdependency and a heightened sensitivity between each individual of the group . Only 2 - 3 actors were allowed on the stage at one time , and masks permitted quick transitions from one character to another . There were only male actors , but masks allowed them to play female characters .	what was the purpose of masks in greek theatre	ask_question

757	The Currency Act of 1764 ( 4 Geo . III c. 34 ) extended the 1751 Act to all of the British colonies of North America . Unlike the earlier Act , this statute did not prohibit the colonies from issuing paper money , but it did forbid them from designating future currency emissions as legal tender for public and private debts . This tight money policy created financial difficulties in the colonies , where gold and silver were in short supply . Benjamin Franklin , a colonial agent in London , lobbied for repeal of the Act over the next several years , as did other agents . The act arose when Virginia farmers continued to import during the French and Indian War . Virginia issued 250,000 pounds in bills of credit to finance both public and private debts . This legislation differed from the 1751 act in that it prohibited the colonists from designating paper currency for use as payment for any debts , public or private . Parliament did not , however , prohibit the colonists from issuing paper money . The Act was put into place as a hedge against risks associated with economic fluctuations and uncertainty .	who was involved in the currency act of 1764	ask_question

759	Delia Finkel died in August 1921 , shortly after the Walla Walla Bulletin article was published , and in 1926 Frank married his second wife , Hermie . Frank Finkel died at age 76 on August 28 , 1930 . In 2013 , a photograph described as `` August Finckle '' was published first in the `` Battlefield Dispatch , '' a membership - circulation publication for Custer enthusiasts , and then in the December 2013 issue of `` Wild West , '' a professionally edited general - circulation magazine of the Weider History Group . The photograph , described as `` Sergeant August Finckle '' of the Seventh Cavalry in an 1874 cavalry blouse , was widely identified as a photograph of Frank Finkel of Ohio taken 10 years before the familiar Frank Finkel portrait photograph taken around 1886 . The hair color and hairline differed due to age , but every facial feature was identical , as were several mannerisms , including the shirt collar flipped up on the right side inside the coat collar , according to Mike Roncallo , a portrait photographer with NJ Press credentials , Sylvia Groen , a portrait painter , Police Chief Benjamin Fox of Wyckoff , NJ , and Jacques Harlow , a professional engineer with a degree from Dartmouth and a Fulbright Scholar with ID training from NYU . The owner of the photograph was a friend of Frank Finckle , fellow soldier and mentions burying Frank Finckle in the same Dispatch article . Four men claimed to identify Finckle and his horse , both dead on Finley Finckle Ridge . They do not name parts of battlefields for missing soldiers . Conversely , Finckle 's best friend , Charles Windolph , rode down from Reno Hill expressly to find Finckle 's body and give him a decent burial and could not find the body . `` I tried to find the body of my German friend , Trooper Finkle , the tallest man in the regiment , But I could not identify him , '' Windolph , a Medal of Honor recipient and the last living soldier survivor of the battle , said in `` I Fought With Custer . '' Windolph 's daughter told Dr. Arthur Kannenberg `` After the battle Daddy says he looked everywhere for him as he was like a brother to him -- but the bodies were so disfigured that he was unable to find him . '' Dr. Kannenberg showed Windolph a photograph of Frank Finkel as an old man of 66 but Windolph , who was almost blind by that time , could not say whether the photograph resembled Sergeant August Finckle or not . None of the people who claimed to have buried Finckle ever gave a detailed description of how they might have recognized his body . The final report of the primary source , Sergeant Daniel Kanipe , was described as full of inaccuracies by Col. W.A. Graham in `` The Custer Myth . '' Kanipe also described 60 , 70 , or 75 dead Indians when the Indians reported losing only 26 warriors and listed them by name . Kanipe said General Custer was shot once when every other witness said Custer was shot twice . Kanipe failed to identify his own company commander , Tom Custer , who had been beaten to a pulp . Kanipe apparently identified the body of `` Finckle '' for Lt. Edward Godfrey , who did not appear to know Finckle by sight . Sergeant Samuel Alcott was not present at the actual battle and describes the burial he attended as taking place on a `` barren plain '' when it was actually on a hillside . The article in `` Battlefield Dispatch '' also stated that native - born German speakers reported having trouble understanding `` Sergeant Finckle 's '' German pronunciation . Author Koster said that this was because Frank Finkel grew up in Ohio , had never lived in Germany , and had learned the Alemannic Bavarian dialect from his immigrant parents .	did anyone survive the battle of little bighorn	ask_question

764	In 1917 , with Russia experiencing political upheaval following widespread disillusionment there over the war , and with Britain and France low on credit , Germany appeared to have the upper hand in Europe , while the Ottoman Empire clung to its possessions in the Middle East . In the same year , Germany decided to resume unrestricted submarine warfare against any vessel approaching British waters ; this attempt to starve Britain into surrender was balanced against the knowledge that it would almost certainly bring the United States into the war . Germany also made a secret offer to help Mexico regain territories lost in the Mexican -- American War in an encoded telegram known as the Zimmermann Telegram , which was intercepted by British Intelligence . Publication of that communique outraged Americans just as German U-boats started sinking American merchant ships in the North Atlantic . Wilson then asked Congress for `` a war to end all wars '' that would `` make the world safe for democracy '' , and Congress voted to declare war on Germany on April 6 , 1917 .

790	Treaty power is a co-ordinated effort between the Executive branch and the Senate . The President may form and negotiate , but the treaty must be advised and consented to by a two - thirds vote in the Senate . Only after the Senate approves the treaty can the President ratify it . Once it is ratified , it becomes binding on all the states under the Supremacy Clause . While the House of Representatives does not vote on it at all , the requirement for the Senate 's advice and consent to ratification makes it considerably more difficult to rally enough political support for international treaties . Also , if implementation of the treaty requires the expenditure of funds , the House of Representatives may be able to block or at least impede such implementation by refusing to vote for the appropriation of the necessary funds .	who is in charge of ratifying treaties in the us	ask_question

795	During the Great Depression , popcorn was fairly inexpensive at 5 -- 10 cents a bag and became popular . Thus , while other businesses failed , the popcorn business thrived and became a source of income for many struggling farmers , including the Redenbacher family , namesake of the famous popcorn brand . During World War II , sugar rations diminished candy production , and Americans compensated by eating three times as much popcorn as they had before . The snack was popular at theaters , much to the initial displeasure of many of the theater owners , who thought it distracted from the films . Their minds eventually changed , however , and in 1938 a Midwestern theater owner named Glen W. Dickson installed popcorn machines in the lobbies of his theaters .

796	The CFTR gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 7 , at position q31. 2 , and ultimately codes for a sequence of 1,480 amino acids . Normally , the three DNA base pairs A-T-C ( paired with T-A-G on the opposite strand ) at the gene 's 507th position form the template for the mRNA codon A-U-C for isoleucine , while the three DNA base pairs T-T-T ( paired with A-A-A ) at the adjacent 508th position form the template for the codon U-U-U for phenylalanine . The ΔF508 mutation is a deletion of the C-G pair from position 507 along with the first two T-A pairs from position 508 , leaving the DNA sequence A-T-T ( paired with T-A-A ) at position 507 , which is transcribed into the mRNA codon A-U-U . Since A-U-U also codes for isoleucine , position 507 's amino acid does not change , and the mutation 's net effect is equivalent to a deletion ( `` Δ '' ) of the sequence resulting in the codon for phenylalanine at position 508 .	what dna changes produce the delta f508 mutation	ask_question

798	External threats closely shaped the course of the Revolution . The Revolutionary Wars beginning in 1792 ultimately featured French victories that facilitated the conquest of the Italian Peninsula , the Low Countries and most territories west of the Rhine -- achievements that had eluded previous French governments for centuries . Internally , popular agitation radicalised the Revolution significantly , culminating in the rise of Maximilien Robespierre and the Jacobins . The dictatorship imposed by the Committee of Public Safety during the Reign of Terror , from 1793 until 1794 , established price controls on food and other items , abolished slavery in French colonies abroad , dechristianised society through the creation of a new calendar and the expulsion of religious figures , and secured the borders of the new republic from its enemies . Large numbers of civilians were executed by revolutionary tribunals during the Terror , with estimates ranging from 16,000 to 40,000 . After the Thermidorian Reaction , an executive council known as the Directory assumed control of the French state in 1795 . The rule of the Directory was characterised by suspended elections , debt repudiations , financial instability , persecutions against the Catholic clergy , and significant military conquests abroad . Dogged by charges of corruption , the Directory collapsed in a coup led by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1799 . Napoleon , who became the hero of the Revolution through his popular military campaigns , went on to establish the Consulate and later the First Empire , setting the stage for a wider array of global conflicts in the Napoleonic Wars .	what emperor took over france after the reign of terror	ask_question

801	Seafloor spreading is a process that occurs at mid-ocean ridges , where new oceanic crust is formed through volcanic activity and then gradually moves away from the ridge . Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics . When oceanic plates diverge , tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere. The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure , although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges . At a spreading center basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed . Hydrothermal vents are common at spreading centers . Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone . Additionally spreading rates determine if the ridge is a fast , intermediate , or slow . As a general rule , fast ridges see spreading rate of more than 9 cm / year . Intermediate ridges have a spreading rate of 4 -- 9 cm / year while slow spreading ridges have a rate less than 4 cm / year .	where does new crust come from in sea floor spreading	ask_question

813	One common way to extinguish a fire is to spray it with water . The water has two roles : It vaporizes when it comes in contact with fire , and this vapor displaces the oxygen ( the volume of water vapor is 1,700 times greater than liquid water , at 1,000 ° F ( 538 ° C ) it expands over 4,000 times ) . This leaves the fire without enough of the combustive agent , and it dies out . The vaporization of water also absorbs heat ; it thereby cools the smoke , air , walls , and objects that could act as further fuel , and thus prevents one of the means by which fires grow , which is by `` jumping '' to nearby heat / fuel sources to start new fires , which then combine . Water extinguishment is thus a combination of `` asphyxia '' ( cutting off the oxygen supply ) and cooling . The flame itself is suppressed by asphyxia , but the cooling is the most important element in mastering a fire in a closed area .	the removal of temperature in fire fighting method is known as	ask_question

816	The optic nerve leaves the orbit ( eye socket ) via the optic canal , running postero - medially towards the optic chiasm , where there is a partial decussation ( crossing ) of fibres from the temporal visual fields ( the nasal hemi - retina ) of both eyes . The proportion of decussating fibers varies between species , and is correlated with the degree of binocular vision enjoyed by a species . Most of the axons of the optic nerve terminate in the lateral geniculate nucleus from where information is relayed to the visual cortex , while other axons terminate in the pretectal nucleus and are involved in reflexive eye movements . Other axons terminate in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and are involved in regulating the sleep - wake cycle . Its diameter increases from about 1.6 mm within the eye to 3.5 mm in the orbit to 4.5 mm within the cranial space . The optic nerve component lengths are 1 mm in the globe , 24 mm in the orbit , 9 mm in the optic canal , and 16 mm in the cranial space before joining the optic chiasm . There , partial decussation occurs , and about 53 % of the fibers cross to form the optic tracts .

837	In meteorology , precipitation is any product of the condensation of atmospheric water vapor that falls under gravity . The main forms of precipitation include drizzle , rain , sleet , snow , graupel and hail . Precipitation occurs when a portion of the atmosphere becomes saturated with water vapor , so that the water condenses and `` precipitates '' . Thus , fog and mist are not precipitation but suspensions , because the water vapor does not condense sufficiently to precipitate . Two processes , possibly acting together , can lead to air becoming saturated : cooling the air or adding water vapor to the air . Precipitation forms as smaller droplets coalesce via collision with other rain drops or ice crystals within a cloud . Short , intense periods of rain in scattered locations are called `` showers . ''	what are the four main types of precipitation	ask_question

854	A photoelectric , or optical smoke detector contains a source of infrared , visible , or ultraviolet light ( typically an incandescent light bulb or light - emitting diode ) , a lens , and a photoelectric receiver ( typically a photodiode ) . In spot - type detectors all of these components are arranged inside a chamber where air , which may contain smoke from a nearby fire , flows . In large open areas such as atria and auditoriums , optical beam or projected - beam smoke detectors are used instead of a chamber within the unit : a wall - mounted unit emits a beam of infrared or ultraviolet light which is either received and processed by a separate device , or reflected back to the receiver by a reflector . In some types , particularly optical beam types , the light emitted by the light source passes through the air being tested and reaches the photosensor . The received light intensity will be reduced due to scattering from particulates of smoke , air - borne dust , or other substances ; the circuitry detects the light intensity and generates the alarm if it is below a specified threshold , potentially due to smoke . In other types , typically chamber types , the light is not directed at the sensor , which is not illuminated in the absence of particles . If the air in the chamber contains particles ( smoke or dust ) , the light is scattered and some of it reaches the sensor , triggering the alarm .	which type of fire detector uses the effect of smoke on a light source and photo-electric cell	ask_question

890	Mendel worked with seven characteristics of pea plants : plant height , pod shape and color , seed shape and color , and flower position and color . Taking seed color as an example , Mendel showed that when a true - breeding yellow pea and a true - breeding green pea were cross-bred their offspring always produced yellow seeds . However , in the next generation , the green peas reappeared at a ratio of 1 green to 3 yellow . To explain this phenomenon , Mendel coined the terms `` recessive '' and `` dominant '' in reference to certain traits . ( In the preceding example , the green trait , which seems to have vanished in the first filial generation , is recessive and the yellow is dominant . ) He published his work in 1866 , demonstrating the actions of invisible `` factors '' -- now called genes -- in predictably determining the traits of an organism .	who is the father of genetics and what did he study	ask_question

913	However , reference to the harp as the arms of the king of Ireland can be found in one of the oldest medieval rolls of arms . The Wijnbergen Roll , a French roll of arms dating from c. 1280 and preserved in The Hague , Netherlands , attributed `` D'azure a la harpe d'or '' ( English : Blue with a harp of gold ) to the King of Ireland ( `` le Roi d'Irlande '' ) . The harp , traditionally associated with King David , was a rare charge on medieval rolls and only two arms with a harp are listed in a collection of 19 early rolls . Triangular devices appeared on medieval Irish coinage by kings John and Edward I in the 12th and 13th centuries . These devices may have been crude harps or it may be that the harp developed from the use of triangles to distinguish Irish coins . The idea of a harp being the arms of Ireland may have originated as a reference to a fictional character , le roi d'irelande , in the courtly legend cycle of Tristan . Alternatively , it may have derived from a celebrated 13th century bardic poem , Tabhroidh Chugam Cruit mo Riogh , dedicated to the Donnchadh Cairbreach O'Briain ( d . 1242 ) , a Gaelic King of Thomond .	what is the meaning of the harp in ireland	ask_question

972	The kudzu plant was introduced to the United States from Japan in 1876 at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia . Kudzu was introduced to the Southeast in 1883 at the New Orleans Exposition . The vine was widely marketed in the Southeast as an ornamental plant to be used to shade porches , and in the first half of the 20th century , kudzu was distributed as a high - protein content cattle fodder and as a cover plant to prevent soil erosion . It was cultivated by Civilian Conservation Corps workers as a solution for the erosion during the Dust Bowl . The Soil Erosion Service recommended the use of kudzu to help control erosion of slopes which led to the government - aided distribution of 85 million seedlings and government - funded plantings of kudzu which paid $19.75 per hectare . By 1946 , it was estimated that 1,200,000 hectares ( 3,000,000 acres ) of kudzu had been planted . When boll weevil infestations and the failure of cotton crops caused farmers to abandon their farms , kudzu plantings were left unattended .

In 1953 the United States Department of Agriculture removed kudzu from a list of suggested cover plants and listed it as a weed in 1970 . By 1997 , the vine was placed on the `` Federal Noxious Weed List '' . Today , kudzu is estimated to cover 3,000,000 hectares ( 7,400,000 acres ) of land in the southeastern United States , mostly in Alabama , Georgia , Tennessee , Florida , North Carolina , South Carolina and Mississippi .

989	Plasmodesmata ( singular : plasmodesma ) are microscopic channels which traverse the cell walls of plant cells and some algal cells , enabling transport and communication between them . Plasmodesmata evolved independently in several lineages , and species that have these structures include members of the Charophyceae , Charales , Coleochaetales and Phaeophyceae ( which are all algae ) , as well as all embryophytes , better known as land plants . Unlike animal cells , almost every plant cell is surrounded by a polysaccharide cell wall . Neighbouring plant cells are therefore separated by a pair of cell walls and the intervening middle lamella , forming an extracellular domain known as the apoplast .

Each tractate is divided into chapters ( perakim ; singular : perek ) , 517 in total , that are both numbered according to the Hebrew alphabet and given names , usually using the first one or two words in the first mishnah .

1002	Gestalt psychology or gestaltism ( German : Gestalt ( ɡəˈʃtalt ) `` shape , form '' ) is a philosophy of mind of the Berlin School of experimental psychology . Gestalt psychology is an attempt to understand the laws behind the ability to acquire and maintain meaningful perceptions in an apparently chaotic world . The central principle of gestalt psychology is that the mind forms a global whole with self - organizing tendencies . The assumed physiological mechanisms on which Gestalt theory rests are poorly defined and support for their existence is lacking . The Gestalt theory of perception has been criticized as being descriptive of the end products of perception without providing much insight into the processes that lead to perception . In the introduction to a 2016 special issue of the journal Vision Research on Gestalt perception , the authors concluded that `` even though they study the same phenomena as earlier Gestaltists , there is little theoretical coherence . What happened to the Gestalt school that always aspired to provide a unified vision of psychology ? Perhaps there is , in fact , little that holds the classic phenomena of Gestalt psychology together . ''	today gestalt psychology ideas are part of which branch of psychology	ask_question
1003	Long John Silver is a cunning and opportunistic pirate who was quartermaster under the notorious Captain Flint . Long John Silver had a pet parrot called Captain Flint , often seen sitting on his shoulder where she would nibble on seeds . Silver claims to have served in the Royal Navy and lost his leg under `` the immortal Hawke '' . `` His left leg was cut off close by the hip , and under the left shoulder , he carried a crutch , which he managed with wonderful dexterity , hopping about upon it like a bird . He was very tall and strong , with a face as big as a ham -- plain and pale , but intelligent and smiling . '' ( Treasure Island ( 1883 ) by Robert Louis Stevenson page 82 ) . He claims to have been the only man whom Flint ever feared . Like many of Stevenson 's characters , there is more than a modicum of duality in the character ; ostensibly Silver is a hardworking and likeable seaman , and it is only as the plot unfolds that his villainous nature is gradually revealed . His relationship with Jim Hawkins , the novel 's protagonist and narrator , is interesting , as he serves as a mentor and eventually father - figure to Jim , creating much shock and emotion when it is discovered that he is in charge of the mutiny , and especially when Jim must confront and fight him later on . Although willing to change sides at any time to further his own interests , Silver has compensating virtues : he is wise enough to pay attention to money management , in contrast to the spendthrift ways of most of the pirates , and is physically courageous despite his disability ; for instance , when Flint 's cache is found to be empty , he coolly stands his ground against five active seamen despite having only Jim , a boy in his teens , to back him .	how did long john silver lose his leg in treasure island	ask_question

1012	`` Wah - Wah '' is a song by English musician George Harrison , released on his 1970 triple album All Things Must Pass . Harrison wrote the song following his temporary departure from the Beatles in January 1969 , during the troubled Get Back sessions that resulted in their Let It Be album and film . The lyrics reflect his frustration with the atmosphere in the group at that time -- namely , Paul McCartney 's over-assertiveness and criticism of his guitar playing , John Lennon 's lack of engagement with the project and dismissal of Harrison as a songwriter , and Yoko Ono 's constant involvement in the band 's activities . Music critics and biographers recognise the song as Harrison 's statement of personal and artistic freedom from the Beatles .

1030	Every person accused of a crime punishable by incarceration for more than six months has a constitutionally protected right to a trial by jury , which arises in federal court from Article Three of the United States Constitution , which states in part , `` The Trial of all Crimes ... shall be by Jury ; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed . '' The right was expanded with the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution , which states in part , `` In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed . '' Both provisions were made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment . Most states ' constitutions also grant the right of trial by jury in lesser criminal matters , though most have abrogated that right in offenses punishable by fine only . The Supreme Court has ruled that if imprisonment is for six months or less , trial by jury is not required , meaning a state may choose whether or not to permit trial by jury in such cases .

1100	Parietal cells ( also known as oxyntic or delomorphous cells ) , are the epithelial cells that secrete hydrochloric acid ( HCl ) and intrinsic factor . These cells are located in the gastric glands found in the lining of the fundus and in the body of the stomach . They contain an extensive secretory network ( called canaliculi ) from which the HCl is secreted by active transport into the stomach . The enzyme hydrogen potassium ATPase ( H / K ATPase ) is unique to the parietal cells and transports the H against a concentration gradient of about 3 million to 1 , which is the steepest ion gradient formed in the human body . Parietal cells are primarily regulated via histamine , acetylcholine and gastrin signaling from both central and local modulators ( see ' Regulation ' ) .	the site of secretion of h+ and cl-	ask_question

1104	There are several different units in use around the world for defining blood alcohol concentration . Each is defined as either a mass of alcohol per volume of blood or a mass of alcohol per mass of blood ( never a volume per volume ) . 1 milliliter of blood has a mass of approximately 1.06 grams . Because of this , units by volume are similar but not identical to units by mass . In the U.S. the concentration unit 1 % w / v ( percent mass / volume , equivalent to 10 g / l or 1 g per 100 ml ) is in use . This is not to be confused with the amount of alcohol measured on the breath , as with a breathalyzer . The amount of alcohol measured on the breath is generally accepted as proportional to the amount of alcohol present in the blood at a rate of 1 : 2100 . Therefore , a breathalyzer measurement of 0.10 mg / L of breath alcohol converts to 0.0001 × 2100 g / 10dL , or 0.021 g / dL of blood alcohol ( the units of the BAC in the United States ) . While a variety of units ( or sometimes lack thereof ) is used throughout the world , many countries use the g / L unit , which does not create confusion as percentages do . Usual units are highlighted in the table below .	blood alcohol concentration means the parts of alcohol in the blood in relation to what	ask_question

1106	The famous order `` Do n't fire until you see the whites of their eyes '' was popularized in stories about the battle of Bunker Hill . It is uncertain as to who said it there , since various histories , including eyewitness accounts , attribute it to Putnam , Stark , Prescott , or Gridley , and it may have been said first by one , and repeated by the others . It was also not an original statement . The idea dates originally to the general - king Gustavus Adolphus ( 1594 -- 1632 ) who gave standing orders to his musketeers : `` never to give fire , till they could see their own image in the pupil of their enemy 's eye '' . Gustavus Adolphus 's military teachings were widely admired and imitated and caused this saying to be often repeated . It was used by General James Wolfe on the Plains of Abraham , when his troops defeated Montcalm 's army on September 13 , 1759 . The earliest similar quote came from the Battle of Dettingen on June 27 , 1743 , where Lieutenant - Colonel Sir Andrew Agnew of Lochnaw warned his Regiment , the Royal Scots Fusiliers , not to fire until they could `` see the white of their e'en . '' The phrase was also used by Prince Charles of Prussia in 1745 , and repeated in 1755 by Frederick the Great , and may have been mentioned in histories the colonial military leaders were familiar with . Whether or not it was actually said in this battle , it was clear that the colonial military leadership were regularly reminding their troops to hold their fire until the moment when it would have the greatest effect , especially in situations where their ammunition would be limited .	who said don't shoot until you see	ask_question

1220	The main function of the ARAS is to modify and potentiate thalamic and cortical function such that electroencephalogram ( EEG ) desynchronization ensues . There are distinct differences in the brain 's electrical activity during periods of wakefulness and sleep : Low voltage fast burst brain waves ( EEG desynchronization ) are associated with wakefulness and REM sleep ( which are electrophysiologically similar ) ; high voltage slow waves are found during non-REM sleep . Generally speaking , when thalamic relay neurons are in burst mode the EEG is synchronized and when they are in tonic mode it is desynchronized . Stimulation of the ARAS produces EEG desynchronization by suppressing slow cortical waves ( 0.3 -- 1 Hz ) , delta waves ( 1 -- 4 Hz ) , and spindle wave oscillations ( 11 -- 14 Hz ) and by promoting gamma band ( 20 -- 40 Hz ) oscillations .	what is the result of electrical stimulation to the reticular formation	ask_question

Tywin bitterly claims that he had wanted to drown Tyrion upon birth , but stayed himself for the sake of duty . In season 4 , Tyrion welcomes Prince Oberyn Martell of Dorne to King 's Landing for Joffrey 's wedding to Margaery Tyrell , though Oberyn implies to Tyrion that his true purpose is to seek vengeance for his sister , who was murdered by Ser Gregor Clegane on Tywin 's orders . When Joffrey is fatally poisoned , Tyrion is framed and arrested . Tyrion , however , implies that Cersei knows of his innocence and just wants him dead . At Tyrion 's trial , he demands a trial by combat . Tyrion is approached by Oberyn , who volunteers to be his champion in order to fight Cersei 's champion , Ser Gregor Clegane . When Oberyn loses the fight and is killed , Tyrion is sentenced to death . Jaime , however , frees Tyrion and arranges for him to escape King 's Landing . Tyrion goes to confront Tywin in his chambers but finds Shae , who testified against him and is now Tywin 's lover . After a brief struggle , Tyrion strangles Shae to death , and Tyrion shoots Tywin to death with Joffrey 's crossbow . Tyrion is then placed in a crate and smuggled off to Essos with help from Varys . They arrive in Pentos , where Varys manages to convince Tyrion to travel with him to Meereen and aid Daenerys Targaryen in retaking the Iron Throne . Tyrion is bound and gagged by Jorah Mormont , who says that he will take him to Daenerys . Daenerys takes them both to her home in the Great Pyramid of Meereen and asks Tyrion why he is here . Tyrion tells her everything , including Varys ' plan . He initially counsels her to stay in Meereen , but Daenerys makes it plain to him that her eyes are still on Westeros . Tyrion tells Daenerys how hard it will be to win the love of both the common people and the nobles . He later joins her at the opening celebrations of Daznak 's Pit , where Jorah unexpectedly reappears to defeat every other foe on the arena . As the Sons of the Harpy attack , Tyrion manages to survive by fleeing to the midst of the arena , where they are rescued by Drogon , while Daenerys is spirited away on his back . In season 6 , Tyrion struggles to maintain peace in Meereen , particularly when the Sons of the Harpy burn the entire Meereenese Navy , stranding them in Slaver 's Bay . Following an alliance with Theon and Yara Greyjoy , Tyrion advises Daenerys to break up with Daario so that she may pursue a marriage alliance in Westeros . In gratitude for Tyrion 's loyalty , Daenerys names him her official Hand , and he accompanies her back to Westeros . In season 7 Tyrion 's advice to Daenerys often conflicts with her views , and he has mixed success in directing her actions . He sneaks into King 's Landing and meets with Jamie to set up a meeting between Cersei and Daenerys , which eventually happens in the Dragonpit outside the city . At the meeting a captured wight is produced to convince Cersei that the worst threat is from beyond the Wall . When Cersei is not convinced , Tyrion risks execution to meet with his sister to try again to persuade her .

1323	where C H O is glucose ( which is subsequently transformed into other sugars , cellulose , lignin , and so forth ) . The value of the photosynthetic efficiency is dependent on how light energy is defined -- it depends on whether we count only the light that is absorbed , and on what kind of light is used ( see Photosynthetically active radiation ) . It takes eight ( or perhaps 10 or more ) photons to utilize one molecule of CO . The Gibbs free energy for converting a mole of CO to glucose is 114 kcal , whereas eight moles of photons of wavelength 600 nm contains 381 kcal , giving a nominal efficiency of 30 % . However , photosynthesis can occur with light up to wavelength 720 nm so long as there is also light at wavelengths below 680 nm to keep Photosystem II operating ( see Chlorophyll ) . Using longer wavelengths means less light energy is needed for the same number of photons and therefore for the same amount of photosynthesis . For actual sunlight , where only 45 % of the light is in the photosynthetically active wavelength range , the theoretical maximum efficiency of solar energy conversion is approximately 11 % . In actuality , however , plants do not absorb all incoming sunlight ( due to reflection , respiration requirements of photosynthesis and the need for optimal solar radiation levels ) and do not convert all harvested energy into biomass , which results in an overall photosynthetic efficiency of 3 to 6 % of total solar radiation . If photosynthesis is inefficient , excess light energy must be dissipated to avoid damaging the photosynthetic apparatus . Energy can be dissipated as heat ( non-photochemical quenching ) , or emitted as chlorophyll fluorescence .	what percentage of sunlight is captured by plants to convert it into food energy	ask_question

1375	Zhōngguó is the most common sinitic name for China in modern times . The first appearance of 中國 on an artifact was in the Western Zhou on a ritual vessel known as He zun . It is formed by combining the characters zhōng ( 中 ) meaning `` central '' or `` middle '' , and guó ( 國 / 国 ) , representing `` state '' or `` states '' ; in contemporary usage , `` nation '' . Prior to the Qin unification of China `` Zhongguo '' referred to the `` Central States '' ; the connotation was the primacy of a culturally distinct core area , centered on the Yellow River valley , as distinguished from the tribal periphery . In later periods , however , `` Zhongguo '' was not used in this sense . Dynastic names were used for the state in Imperial China and concepts of the state aside from the ruling dynasty were little understood . Rather , the country was called by the name of the dynasty , such as `` Han dynasty '' ( Hanchao 漢 朝 ) , `` Tang dynasty '' ( Tangchao 唐 朝 ) , `` The Great Ming '' ( Daming 大明 ) , `` The Great Qing '' ( Daqing 大 清 ) , as the case might be .

Certain northern counties , like Durham and Cumberland , had been the victim of violent incursions from the Scots , and were therefore left particularly vulnerable to the devastations of the plague . Pestilence is less virulent during the winter months , and spreads less rapidly . The Black Death in England had survived the winter of 1348 -- 49 , but during the following winter it gave in , and by December 1349 conditions were returning to relative normalcy .

1387	Running parallel to the shoreline about 5 miles ( 8.0 km ) from Utah Beach , the marshes of the Merderet and Douve formed a natural defensive line protecting the western end of the Allied landing zone and at the same time limiting the Allies ' potential to break out of the beachhead . Thus control of the bridges at Manoir de la Fière and Chef - du - Pont was seen as vital . The Merderet was assigned to the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division as Mission Boston , scheduled for 5 hours before the amphibious landings on D - Day . Cloud cover and German fire caused the landings to be dispersed ; the paratroopers took the strategic town of Sainte - Mère - Église but failed in their original mission to clear the west bank of the Merderet on D - Day and blow the bridge over the Douze at Pont l'Abbé ( now Étienville ) . The extent of their control of the bridges over the Merderet is disputed , but it was sufficient to hold off German counterattacks . These included an attack over the causeway at La Fiere by the 1057th Grenadier Regiment and light tanks of the 100th Panzer Replacement Battalion .

1399	In Genesis 17 when Abram was ninety - nine years old , God declared his new name : `` Abraham '' -- `` a father of many nations '' , and gave him the covenant of circumcision . God gave Sarai the new name `` Sarah '' , and blessed her . Abraham was given assurance that Sarah would have a son . Not long afterwards , Abraham and Sarah were visited by three men . One of the visitors told Abraham that upon his return next year , Sarah would have a son . While at the tent entrance , Sarah overheard what was said , and she laughed to herself about the prospect of having a child at their ages . The visitor inquired of Abraham why Sarah laughed at the idea of bearing a child , for her age was as nothing to God . Sarah soon became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham , at the very time which had been spoken . The patriarch , then a hundred years old , named the child `` Isaac '' ( Hebrew yitschaq , `` laughter '' ) and circumcised him when he was eight days old . For Sarah , the thought of giving birth and nursing a child , at such an old age , also brought her much laughter , as she declared , `` God had made me to laugh , ( so that ) all that hear will laugh with me . '' Abraham held a great feast on the day when Isaac was to be weaned . It was during this banquet that Sarah happened upon the then teenaged Ishmael mocking and was so disturbed that she requested that both he and Hagar be removed from their company .

1402	Since the late 1970s , the use of CFCs has been heavily regulated because of their destructive effects on the ozone layer . After the development of his electron capture detector , James Lovelock was the first to detect the widespread presence of CFCs in the air , finding a mole fraction of 60 ppt of CFC - 11 over Ireland . In a self - funded research expedition ending in 1973 , Lovelock went on to measure CFC - 11 in both the Arctic and Antarctic , finding the presence of the gas in each of 50 air samples collected , and concluding that CFCs are not hazardous to the environment . The experiment did however provide the first useful data on the presence of CFCs in the atmosphere . The damage caused by CFCs was discovered by Sherry Rowland and Mario Molina who , after hearing a lecture on the subject of Lovelock 's work , embarked on research resulting in the first publication suggesting the connection in 1974 . It turns out that one of CFCs ' most attractive features -- their low reactivity -- is key to their most destructive effects . CFCs ' lack of reactivity gives them a lifespan that can exceed 100 years , giving them time to diffuse into the upper stratosphere . Once in the stratosphere , the sun 's ultraviolet radiation is strong enough to cause the homolytic cleavage of the C - Cl bond .	when was the problem of cfc's discovered	ask_question
1403	Electromagnetic waves are typically described by any of the following three physical properties : the frequency f , wavelength λ , or photon energy E. Frequencies observed in astronomy range from 7023239999999999999 ♠ 2.4 × 10 Hz ( 1 GeV gamma rays ) down to the local plasma frequency of the ionized interstellar medium ( ~ 1 kHz ) . Wavelength is inversely proportional to the wave frequency , so gamma rays have very short wavelengths that are fractions of the size of atoms , whereas wavelengths on the opposite end of the spectrum can be as long as the universe . Photon energy is directly proportional to the wave frequency , so gamma ray photons have the highest energy ( around a billion electron volts ) , while radio wave photons have very low energy ( around a femtoelectronvolt ) .

1487	Gravity , or gravitation , is a natural phenomenon by which all things with mass are brought toward ( or gravitate toward ) one another , including objects ranging from atoms and photons , to planets and stars . Since energy and mass are equivalent , all forms of energy ( including light ) cause gravitation and are under the influence of it . On Earth , gravity gives weight to physical objects , and the Moon 's gravity causes the ocean tides . The gravitational attraction of the original gaseous matter present in the Universe caused it to begin coalescing , forming stars -- and for the stars to group together into galaxies -- so gravity is responsible for many of the large scale structures in the Universe .

1513	A typical explanation found in the scientific literature for the evolution of light hair is related to the evolution of light skin , and in turn the requirement for vitamin D synthesis and northern Europe 's seasonal less solar radiation . Lighter skin is due to a low concentration in pigmentation , thus allowing more sunlight to trigger the production of vitamin D. In this way , high frequencies of light hair in northern latitudes are a result of the light skin adaptation to lower levels of solar radiation , which reduces the prevalence of rickets caused by vitamin D deficiency . The darker pigmentation at higher latitudes in certain ethnic groups such as the Inuit is explained by a greater proportion of seafood in their diet and by the climate which they live in , because in the polar climate there is more ice or snow on the ground , and this reflects the solar radiation onto the skin , making this environment lack the conditions for the person to have blond , brown or red hair , light skin and blue , grey or green eyes .	where does blonde hair green eyes come from	ask_question

1579	The Berlin Wall ( German : Berliner Mauer , pronounced ( bɛʁˈliːnɐ ˈmaʊ̯ɐ ) ( listen ) ) was a guarded concrete barrier that physically and ideologically divided Berlin from 1961 to 1989 . Constructed by the German Democratic Republic ( GDR , East Germany ) , starting on 13 August 1961 , the Wall cut off ( by land ) West Berlin from virtually all of surrounding East Germany and East Berlin until government officials opened it in November 1989 . Its demolition officially began on 13 June 1990 and finished in 1992 . The barrier included guard towers placed along large concrete walls , accompanied by a wide area ( later known as the `` death strip '' ) that contained anti-vehicle trenches , `` fakir beds '' and other defenses . The Eastern Bloc portrayed the Wall as protecting its population from fascist elements conspiring to prevent the `` will of the people '' in building a socialist state in East Germany . In practice , the Wall served to prevent the massive emigration and defection that had marked East Germany and the communist Eastern Bloc during the post-World War II period .	when did they knock down the berlin wall	ask_question

1583	The beginning of the empire is conventionally dated to the victory by its founder Babur over Ibrahim Lodi , the last ruler of the Delhi Sultanate , in the First Battle of Panipat ( 1526 ) . The Mughal emperors had roots in the Turco - Mongol Timurid dynasty of Central Asia , claiming direct descent from both Genghis Khan ( founder of the Mongol Empire , through his son Chagatai Khan ) and Timur ( Turco - Mongol conqueror who founded the Timurid Empire ) . During the reign of Humayun , the successor of Babur , the empire was briefly interrupted by the Sur Empire . The `` classic period '' of the Mughal Empire started in 1556 with the ascension of Akbar the Great to the throne . Under the rule of Akbar and his son Jahangir , the region enjoyed economic progress as well as religious harmony , and the monarchs were interested in local religious and cultural traditions .

1589	In the spring of 1928 , Disney asked Ub Iwerks to start drawing up new character ideas . Iwerks tried sketches of various animals , such as dogs and cats , but none of these appealed to Disney . A female cow and male horse were also rejected . They would later turn up as Clarabelle Cow and Horace Horsecollar . A male frog was also rejected . It would later show up in Iwerks ' own Flip the Frog series . Walt Disney got the inspiration for Mickey Mouse from a tame mouse at his desk at Laugh - O - Gram Studio in Kansas City , Missouri . In 1925 , Hugh Harman drew some sketches of mice around a photograph of Walt Disney . These inspired Ub Iwerks to create a new mouse character for Disney . `` Mortimer Mouse '' had been Disney 's original name for the character before his wife , Lillian , convinced him to change it , and ultimately Mickey Mouse came to be . The actor Mickey Rooney claimed that , during his Mickey McGuire days , he met cartoonist Walt Disney at the Warner Brothers studio , and that Disney was inspired to name Mickey Mouse after him . This claim , however , has been debunked by Disney historian Jim Korkis , since at the time of Mickey Mouse 's development , Disney Studios had been located on Hyperion Avenue for several years , and Walt Disney never kept an office or other working space at Warner Brothers , having no professional relationship with Warner Brothers , as the Alice Comedies and Oswald cartoons were distributed by Universal .	where did the idea of mickey mouse come from	ask_question

1592	The peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) is one of the two components of the nervous system , the other part is the central nervous system ( CNS ) . The PNS consists of the nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord . The main function of the PNS is to connect the CNS to the limbs and organs , essentially serving as a relay between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body . Unlike the CNS , the PNS is not protected by the vertebral column and skull , or by the blood -- brain barrier , which leaves it exposed to toxins and mechanical injuries . The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system . In the somatic nervous system , the cranial nerves are part of the PNS with the exception of the optic nerve ( cranial nerve II ) , along with the retina . The second cranial nerve is not a true peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon . Cranial nerve ganglia originated in the CNS . However , the remaining ten cranial nerve axons extend beyond the brain and are therefore considered part of the PNS . The autonomic nervous system is an involuntary control of smooth muscle and glands . The connection between CNS and organs allows the system to be in two different functional states : sympathetic and parasympathetic .	what parts make up the peripheral nervous system	ask_question
1593	After mating , the female spends extra time basking to keep her eggs warm . She may also have a change of diet , eating only certain foods , or not eating as much as she normally would . A female can lay between two and 30 eggs depending on body size and other factors . One female can lay up to five clutches in the same year , and clutches are usually spaced 12 to 36 days apart . The time between mating and egg - laying can be days or weeks . The actual egg fertilization takes place during the egg - laying . This process also permits the laying of fertile eggs the following season , as the sperm can remain viable and available in the female 's body in the absence of mating . During the last weeks of gestation , the female spends less time in the water and smells and scratches at the ground , indicating she is searching for a suitable place to lay her eggs . The female excavates a hole , using her hind legs , and lays her eggs in it .	where do red ear slider turtles lay eggs	ask_question

1606	Full - time employment is employment in which a person works a minimum number of hours defined as such by his / her employer . Full - time employment often comes with benefits that are not typically offered to part - time , temporary , or flexible workers , such as annual leave , sickleave , and health insurance . Part - time jobs are mistakenly thought by some to not be careers . However , legislation exists to stop employers from discriminating against part - time workers so this should not be a factor when making decisions on career advancement . They generally pay more than part - time jobs per hour , and this is similarly discriminatory if the pay decision is based on part - time status as a primary factor . The Fair Labor Standards Act ( FLSA ) does not define full - time employment or part - time employment . This is a matter generally to be determined by the employer ( US Department of Labor ) . The definition by employer can vary and is generally published in a company 's Employee Handbook . Companies commonly require from 35 to 40 hours per week to be defined as full - time and therefore eligible for benefits .	hours of work to be considered full time	ask_question

1621	The endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) is a type of organelle found in eukaryotic cells that forms an interconnected network of flattened , membrane - enclosed sacs or tube - like structures known as cisternae . The membranes of the ER are continuous with the outer nuclear membrane . The endoplasmic reticulum occurs in most types of eukaryotic cells , but is absent from red blood cells and spermatozoa . There are two types of endoplasmic reticulum : rough and smooth . The outer ( cytosolic ) face of the rough endoplasmic reticulum is studded with ribosomes that are the sites of protein synthesis . The rough endoplasmic reticulum is especially prominent in cells such as hepatocytes . The smooth endoplasmic reticulum lacks ribosomes and functions in lipid manufacture and metabolism , the production of steroid hormones , and detoxification . The smooth ER is especially abundant in mammalian liver and gonad cells . The lacy membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum were first seen in 1945 using electron microscopy .	difference in function between rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum	ask_question

One of the most notable PPNA settlements is Jericho in the Levant region , thought to be the world 's first town ( settled around 8500 BC and fortified around 6800 BC ) .

The composition and exact varieties differed from location to location . Woolly mammoths needed a varied diet to support their growth , like modern elephants . An adult of six tonnes would need to eat 180 kg ( 397 lb ) daily , and may have foraged as long as twenty hours every day . The two - fingered tip of the trunk was probably adapted for picking up the short grasses of the last ice age ( Quaternary glaciation , 2.58 million years ago to present ) by wrapping around them , whereas modern elephants curl their trunks around the longer grass of their tropical environments . The trunk could also be used for pulling off large grass tufts , delicately picking buds and flowers , and tearing off leaves and branches where trees and shrubs were present .

1736	Tolkien always strongly held that The Lord of the Rings was not allegorical , particularly in reference to political events of his time such as World War II or the Cold War . At the same time he conceded `` applicability '' as being within the `` freedom '' of the reader , and indeed many people have been inclined to view the One Ring as a symbol or metaphor . The notion of a power too great for humans to safely possess is an evocative one , and already in the 1930s there were technologies available to suggest the idea . By the time the work was published , though not when most of it was written , the existence of nuclear power and nuclear weapons were common knowledge , and the Ring was often taken as symbolic of them . The effect of the Ring and its physical and spiritual after - effects on Bilbo and Frodo are obsessions that have been compared with drug addiction ; actor Andy Serkis who played Gollum in the film trilogy cited drug addiction as an inspiration for his performance .	lord of the rings what does the ring represent	ask_question

De Beers ' market share of rough diamonds fell from as high as 90 % in the 1980s to 33 % in 2013 , because of a more fragmented diamond market bringing greater competition , as well as more transparency and greater liquidity . In November 2011 , the Oppenheimer family announced its intention to sell all its 40 % stake in De Beers to Anglo American plc , thereby increasing Anglo American 's ownership of the company to 85 % ( the other 15 % is owned by the Government of the Republic of Botswana ) .

1742	The Celsius scale was based on 0 ° C for the freezing point of water and 100 ° C for the boiling point of water at 1 atm pressure following a change introduced in 1743 by Jean - Pierre Christin to reverse the Celsius thermometer scale ( from water boiling at 0 degrees and ice melting at 100 degrees ) . This scale is widely taught in schools today . By international agreement the unit `` degree Celsius '' and the Celsius scale are currently defined by two different temperatures : absolute zero , and the triple point of Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water ( VSMOW ) , a specially purified water . This definition also precisely relates the Celsius scale to the Kelvin scale , which defines the SI base unit of thermodynamic temperature with symbol K. Absolute zero , the lowest temperature possible , is defined as being exactly 0 K and − 273.15 ° C.

1763	By 2004 , 58 receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs ) were known , grouped into 20 subfamilies . They play pivotal roles in diverse cellular activities including growth ( by signaling neurotrophins ) , differentiation , metabolism , adhesion , motility , death . RTKs are composed of an extracellular domain , which is able to bind a specific ligand , a transmembrane domain , and an intracellular catalytic domain , which is able to bind and phosphorylate selected substrates . Binding of a ligand to the extracellular region causes a series of structural rearrangements in the RTK that lead to its enzymatic activation . In particular , movement of some parts of the kinase domain gives free access to adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) and the substrate to the active site . This triggers a cascade of events through phosphorylation of intracellular proteins that ultimately transmit ( `` transduce '' ) the extracellular signal to the nucleus , causing changes in gene expression . Many RTKs are involved in oncogenesis , either by gene mutation , or chromosome translocation , or simply by over-expression . In every case , the result is a hyper - active kinase , that confers an aberrant , ligand - independent , non-regulated growth stimulus to the cancer cells .	why does overexpression of rtks lead to cancer development	ask_question

1815	Before 1986 , people often did not obtain a Social Security number until the age of about 14 , since the numbers were used for income tracking purposes , and those under that age seldom had substantial income . The Tax Reform Act of 1986 required parents to list Social Security numbers for each dependent over the age of 5 for whom the parent wanted to claim a tax deduction . Before this act , parents claiming tax deductions were simply trusted not to lie about the number of children they supported . During the first year of the Tax Reform Act , this anti-fraud change resulted in seven million fewer minor dependents being claimed . The disappearance of these dependents is believed to have involved either children who never existed or tax deductions improperly claimed by non-custodial parents . In 1988 , the threshold was lowered to 2 years old , and in 1990 , the threshold was lowered yet again to 1 year old . Today , an SSN is required regardless of the child 's age to receive an exemption .

1816	The nervous system is the part of an animal that coordinates its actions by transmitting signals to and from different parts of its body . Nervous tissue first arose in wormlike organisms about 550 to 600 million years ago . In vertebrates it consists of two main parts , the central nervous system ( CNS ) and the peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) . The CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord . The PNS consists mainly of nerves , which are enclosed bundles of the long fibers or axons , that connect the CNS to every other part of the body . Nerves that transmit signals from the brain are called motor or efferent nerves , while those nerves that transmit information from the body to the CNS are called sensory or afferent . Spinal nerves serve both functions and are called mixed nerves . The PNS is divided into three separate subsystems , the somatic , autonomic , and enteric nervous systems . Somatic nerves mediate voluntary movement . The autonomic nervous system is further subdivided into the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems . The sympathetic nervous system is activated in cases of emergencies to mobilize energy , while the parasympathetic nervous system is activated when organisms are in a relaxed state . The enteric nervous system functions to control the gastrointestinal system . Both autonomic and enteric nervous systems function involuntarily . Nerves that exit from the cranium are called cranial nerves while those exiting from the spinal cord are called spinal nerves .	what is the function and structure of the nervous system	ask_question
1817	Although the safest way to recognize a chord 's root is , after having reduced the chord to close spacing , to rearrange it as a stack of thirds , there are shortcuts to this : in inverted triads , the root is directly above the interval of a fourth , in inverted sevenths , it is directly above the interval of a second . With chord types , such as chords with added sixths or chords over pedal points , more than one possible chordal analysis may be possible . For example , in a tonal piece of music , the notes C , E , G , A , sounded as a chord , could be analyzed as a C major sixth chord in root position ( a major triad -- C , E , G -- with an added sixth -- A -- above the root ) or as a first inversion A minor seventh chord ( the A minor seventh chord contains the notes A , C , E and G , but in this example , the C note , the third of the A minor chord , is in the bass ) . Deciding which note is the root of this chord could be determined by considering context . If the chord spelled C , E , G , A occurs immediately before a D chord ( spelled D , F ♯ , A , C ) , most theorists and musicians would consider the first chord a minor seventh chord in first inversion , because the progression ii -- V is a standard chord movement .	how do you determine what the root of the triad is	ask_question

1830	A river delta is a landform that forms from deposition of sediment carried by a river as the flow leaves its mouth and enters slower - moving or stagnant water . This occurs where a river enters an ocean , sea , estuary , lake , reservoir , or ( more rarely ) another river that can not transport away the supplied sediment . The size and shape of a delta is controlled by the balance between watershed processes that supply sediment and receiving basin processes that redistribute , sequester , and export that sediment . The size , geometry , and location of the receiving basin also plays an important role in delta evolution . River deltas are important in human civilization , as they are major agricultural production centers and population centers . They can provide coastline defense and can impact drinking water supply . They are also ecologically important , with different species assemblages depending on their landscape position .	what is delta and how is it formed	ask_question

1844	A large - scale example of an action performed by the cytoskeleton is muscle contraction . In the muscle , there are groups of highly specialized cells that work together to perform a function known as muscle contraction . A main component in the cytoskeleton that helps show the true function of this muscle contraction is known as a microfilament . Microfilaments are composed of the most abundant cellular protein known as actin . During contraction of a muscle , within each muscle cell , myosin molecular motors collectively exert forces on parallel actin filaments . Muscle contraction starts from nerve impulses which then causes increased amounts of calcium to be released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum . Increases in calcium in the cytosol allows muscle contraction to begin with the help of two proteins , tropomyosin and troponin . Tropomyosin inhibits the interaction between actin and myosin , while troponin senses the increase in calcium and releases the inhibition . This action contracts the muscle cell , and through the synchronous process in many muscle cells , the entire muscle .	the part of the cytoskeleton made from the protein actin is called	ask_question

1878	However , it is possible to narrow the date further . A terminus ante quem for A Shrew seems to be August 1592 , as a stage direction at 3.21 mentions `` Simon , '' which probably refers to the actor Simon Jewell , who was buried on 21 August 1592 . Furthermore , The Shrew must have been written earlier than 1593 , as Anthony Chute 's Beauty Dishonoured , written under the title of Shore 's wife ( published in June 1593 ) contains the line `` He calls his Kate , and she must come and kiss him . '' This must refer to The Shrew , as there is no corresponding `` kissing scene '' in A Shrew . There are also verbal similarities between both Shrew plays and the anonymous play A Knack to Know a Knave ( first performed at The Rose on 10 June 1592 ) . Knack features several passages common to both A Shrew and The Shrew , but it also borrows several passages unique to The Shrew .

1884	Youngstown Sheet and Tube 's announcement had a ripple effect in the area . In 1979 -- 1980 , U.S. Steel pulled out of the Youngstown area and started scaling back its operations in Pittsburgh before eventually merging with Marathon Oil and filing with bankruptcy . In the mid-1980s , Republic Steel also filed for bankruptcy . Attempts to revive the local steel industry proved unsuccessful . Shortly after the closure of most of Youngstown Sheet and Tube 's area operations , local religious leaders , steelworkers , and activists such as Staughton Lynd participated in a grassroots effort to purchase and refurbish one of the company 's abandoned plants in neighboring Campbell , Ohio . This project met with failure in April 1979 . The failure to reopen the mills led Youngstown State University professors Terry Buss and F. Stevens Redburn to conclude that the mill closings resulted from forces beyond the control of the community . Youngstown was simply just one piece of a national problem , and there was no way that Youngstown could solve this problem alone . In 1982 , Staughton Lynd wrote about the effects of the mill closings in Youngstown in the book entitled The Fight Against Black Monday . In the wake of the steel plant shutdowns , the community lost an estimated 40,000 manufacturing jobs , 400 satellite businesses , $414 million in personal income , and from 33 to 75 percent of the school tax revenues . The Youngstown area has yet to fully recover from the loss of jobs in the steel sector .	when did the steel mills closed in youngstown ohio	ask_question

1988	Economists generally believe that high rates of inflation and hyperinflation are caused by an excessive growth of the money supply . Views on which factors determine low to moderate rates of inflation are more varied . Low or moderate inflation may be attributed to fluctuations in real demand for goods and services , or changes in available supplies such as during scarcities . However , the consensus view is that a long sustained period of inflation is caused by money supply growing faster than the rate of economic growth .

Penn made a treaty of friendship with Lenape chief Tammany under an elm tree at Shackamaxon , in what is now the city 's Fishtown neighborhood . Penn named the city Philadelphia , which is Greek for brotherly love , derived from the Ancient Greek terms φίλος phílos ( beloved , dear ) and ἀδελφός adelphós ( brother , brotherly ) .

1998	Polyvinylidene chloride or PVDC can be coated onto a PVC film to obtain very high moisture and oxygen barrier properties depending on the coating weight . PVDC coated blister films are the most common and prevailing barrier films used for pharmaceutical blister packs . PVDC coatings are also the most economical method for adding water barrier and oxygen barrier properties to a PVC film . PVDC blister films are available in 2 or 3 layer specifications referred to as duplex or triplex . Since the PVDC is applied by a coating process , the coating weight is expressed in grams per square meter ( gsm ) . Duplex structures are typically PVC / PVDC films , ranging from 250μPVC / 40gsmPVDC to 250μPVC / 120gsmPVDC with WVTR from 0 , 65 to 0 , 25 g / m2 / d and OTR from 1 to 0 , 1 cc / m2 / d . For very deep draw thermoformed cavities , the triplex specifications are used : PVC / PE / PVDC , where the PE layer assists when forming deeper cavities . The PE ( polyethylene ) forms a soft intermediate layer between the rigid PVC and PVDC layers . Triplex specifications exists in similar coating weights as duplex specifications : 250μPVC / 25μPE / 40gsmPVDC up to 250μPVC / 25μPE / 120gsmPVDC . In order to obtain high barrier properties , PVDC is always applied using an emulsion coating process using a PVDC resin dispersed in water .

2014	Synapsis ( also called syndesis ) is the pairing of two homologous chromosomes that occurs during meiosis . It allows matching - up of homologous pairs prior to their segregation , and possible chromosomal crossover between them . Synapsis takes place during prophase I of meiosis . When homologous chromosomes synapse , their ends are first attached to the nuclear envelope . These end - membrane complexes then migrate , assisted by the extranuclear cytoskeleton , until matching ends have been paired . Then the intervening regions of the chromosome are brought together , and may be connected by a protein - RNA complex called the synaptonemal complex . Autosomes undergo synapsis during meiosis , and are held together by a protein complex along the whole length of the chromosomes called the synaptonemal complex . Sex chromosomes also undergo synapsis ; however , the synaptonemal protein complex that holds the homologous chromosomes together is only present at one end of each sex chromosome .	when does synapsis of homologous chromosomes occur in mitosis	ask_question

2031	Behavioral modernity is a suite of behavioral and cognitive traits that distinguishes current Homo sapiens from other anatomically modern humans , hominins , and primates . Although often debated , most scholars agree that modern human behavior can be characterized by abstract thinking , planning depth , symbolic behavior ( e.g. , art , ornamentation , music ) , exploitation of large game , and blade technology , among others . Underlying these behaviors and technological innovations are cognitive and cultural foundations that have been documented experimentally and ethnographically . Some of these human universal patterns are cumulative cultural adaptation , social norms , language , and extensive help and cooperation beyond close kin . It has been argued that the development of these modern behavioral traits , in combination with the climatic conditions of the Last Glacial Maximum , was largely responsible for the human replacement of Neanderthals and the peopling of the rest of the world .	what does the advent of behavioral modernity refer to	ask_question

They may be based on a range of criteria including `` quality of opposition '' , factors such as how exciting the fighter is or how famous they are , or be an attempt to determine who would win if all those ranked were the same size . In boxing , the term was historically associated with fighters such as Benny Leonard and Sugar Ray Robinson who were widely considered to be the most skilled fighters of their day , to distinguish them from the generally more popular ( and better compensated ) heavyweight champions .

2076	The new style was also encouraged by changes in the economic order and social structure . As the 18th century progressed , the nobility became the primary patrons of instrumental music , while public taste increasingly preferred lighter , funny comic operas . This led to changes in the way music was performed , the most crucial of which was the move to standard instrumental groups and the reduction in the importance of the continuo -- the rhythmic and harmonic groundwork of a piece of music , typically played by a keyboard ( harpsichord or organ ) and usually accompanied by a varied group of bass instruments , including cello , double bass , bass viol , and theorbo . One way to trace the decline of the continuo and its figured chords is to examine the disappearance of the term obbligato , meaning a mandatory instrumental part in a work of chamber music . In Baroque compositions , additional instruments could be added to the continuo group according to the group or leader 's preference ; in Classical compositions , all parts were specifically noted , though not always notated , so the term `` obbligato '' became redundant . By 1800 , basso continuo was practically extinct , except for the occasional use of a pipe organ continuo part in a religious Mass in the early 1800s .	the use of basso continuo was discontinued during the classical era because	ask_question

2236	In the auditory system , sound vibrations ( mechanical energy ) are transduced into electrical energy by hair cells in the inner ear . Sound vibrations from an object cause vibrations in air molecules , which in turn , vibrate your ear drum . The movement of the eardrum causes the bones of your middle ear ( the ossicles ) to vibrate . These vibrations then pass in to the cochlea , the organ of hearing . Within the cochlea , the hair cells on the sensory epithelium of the organ of Corti bend and cause movement of the basilar membrane . The membrane undulates in different sized waves according to the frequency of the sound . Hair cells are then able to convert this movement ( mechanical energy ) into electrical signals ( graded receptor potentials ) which travel along auditory nerves to hearing centres in the brain .	where does transduction occur in the auditory system	ask_question

2247	Between 1877 and 1878 , Oscar Hertwig published several studies on the fertilization of sea urchin eggs , showing that the nucleus of the sperm enters the oocyte and fuses with its nucleus . This was the first time it was suggested that an individual develops from a ( single ) nucleated cell . This was in contradiction to Ernst Haeckel 's theory that the complete phylogeny of a species would be repeated during embryonic development , including generation of the first nucleated cell from a `` monerula '' , a structureless mass of primordial mucus ( `` Urschleim '' ) . Therefore , the necessity of the sperm nucleus for fertilization was discussed for quite some time . However , Hertwig confirmed his observation in other animal groups , including amphibians and molluscs . Eduard Strasburger produced the same results for plants in 1884 . This paved the way to assign the nucleus an important role in heredity . In 1873 , August Weismann postulated the equivalence of the maternal and paternal germ cells for heredity . The function of the nucleus as carrier of genetic information became clear only later , after mitosis was discovered and the Mendelian rules were rediscovered at the beginning of the 20th century ; the chromosome theory of heredity was therefore developed .	what is the center of heredity in a cell	ask_question

2277	The vasomotor center ( VMC ) is a portion of the medulla oblongata that , together with the cardiovascular center and respiratory center , regulates blood pressure and other homeostatic processes . Vasomotor center is a fairly archaic term since this function relies not on a single brain structure ( `` center '' ) but rather represents a presympathetic network of interacting neurons . Upon increase in carbon dioxide level at central chemoreceptors , it stimulates the sympathetic system to constrict vessels . This is opposite to carbon dioxide in tissues causing vasodilatation , especially in the brain . Cranial nerves IX ( Glossopharyngeal nerve ) and X Vagus nerve both feed into the vasomotor centre and are themselves involved in the regulation of blood pressure .

2295	In 1858 Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace published a new evolutionary theory , explained in detail in Darwin 's On the Origin of Species ( 1859 ) . Unlike Lamarck , Darwin proposed common descent and a branching tree of life , meaning that two very different species could share a common ancestor . Darwin based his theory on the idea of natural selection : it synthesized a broad range of evidence from animal husbandry , biogeography , geology , morphology , and embryology . Debate over Darwin 's work led to the rapid acceptance of the general concept of evolution , but the specific mechanism he proposed , natural selection , was not widely accepted until it was revived by developments in biology that occurred during the 1920s through the 1940s . Before that time most biologists regarded other factors as responsible for evolution . Alternatives to natural selection suggested during `` the eclipse of Darwinism '' ( c. 1880 to 1920 ) included inheritance of acquired characteristics ( neo-Lamarckism ) , an innate drive for change ( orthogenesis ) , and sudden large mutations ( saltationism ) . Mendelian genetics , a series of 19th - century experiments with pea plant variations rediscovered in 1900 , was integrated with natural selection by Ronald Fisher , J.B.S. Haldane , and Sewall Wright during the 1910s to 1930s , and resulted in the founding of the new discipline of population genetics . During the 1930s and 1940s population genetics became integrated with other biological fields , resulting in a widely applicable theory of evolution that encompassed much of biology -- the modern synthesis .	who proposed evolution in 1859 as the basis of biological development	ask_question

2303	According to the National Park Service , the idea for the Statue of Liberty was first proposed by Édouard René de Laboulaye the president of the French Anti-Slavery Society and a prominent and important political thinker of his time . The project is traced to a mid-1865 conversation between de Laboulaye , a staunch abolitionist and Frédéric Bartholdi , a sculptor . In after - dinner conversation at his home near Versailles , Laboulaye , an ardent supporter of the Union in the American Civil War , is supposed to have said : `` If a monument should rise in the United States , as a memorial to their independence , I should think it only natural if it were built by united effort -- a common work of both our nations . '' The National Park Service , in a 2000 report , however , deemed this a legend traced to an 1885 fundraising pamphlet , and that the statue was most likely conceived in 1870 . In another essay on their website , the Park Service suggested that Laboulaye was minded to honor the Union victory and its consequences , `` With the abolition of slavery and the Union 's victory in the Civil War in 1865 , Laboulaye 's wishes of freedom and democracy were turning into a reality in the United States . In order to honor these achievements , Laboulaye proposed that a gift be built for the United States on behalf of France .

2308	Unlike passive transport , which uses the kinetic energy and natural entropy of molecules moving down a gradient , active transport uses cellular energy to move them against a gradient , polar repulsion , or other resistance . Active transport is usually associated with accumulating high concentrations of molecules that the cell needs , such as ions , glucose and amino acids . If the process uses chemical energy , such as from adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) , it is termed primary active transport .

Written in a first - person narrative , Clarkson introspectively co-wrote the song to her father , whose abandonment of his family when she was six years old was utilized as a juxtaposition in contrast to her husband 's unconditional love to her and their daughter , whom they had both promised in the song to never leave behind .	the meaning of the song piece by piece	ask_question
2325	The only source of information on the First Temple is the Tanakh . According to the biblical sources , the temple was constructed under Solomon , during the united monarchy of Israel and Judah . The Bible describes Hiram I of Tyre who furnished architects , workmen and cedar timbers for the temple of his ally Solomon at Jerusalem . He also co-operated with Solomon in mounting an expedition on the Red Sea . 1 Kings 6 : 1 puts the date of the beginning of building the temple `` in the fourth year of Solomon 's reign over Israel '' . The conventional dates of Solomon 's reign are circa 970 to 931 BCE . This puts the date of its construction in the mid-10th century BCE . Schmid and Rupprecht are of the view that the site of the temple used to be a Jebusite shrine which Solomon chose in an attempt to unify the Jebusites and Israelites. 1 Kings 9 : 10 says that it took Solomon 20 years altogether to build the Temple and his royal palace . The Temple itself finished being built after 7 years . During the united monarchy the Temple was dedicated to Yahweh , the God of Israel , and housed the Ark of the Covenant . Rabbinic sources state that the First Temple stood for 410 years and , based on the 2nd - century work Seder Olam Rabbah , place construction in 832 BCE and destruction in 422 BCE ( 3338 AM ) , 165 years later than secular estimates .	when was the first temple built in jerusalem	ask_question

2489	Peptidoglycan , also known as murein , is a polymer consisting of sugars and amino acids that forms a mesh - like layer outside the plasma membrane of most bacteria , forming the cell wall . The sugar component consists of alternating residues of β - ( 1 , 4 ) linked N - acetylglucosamine ( NAG ) and N - acetylmuramic acid ( NAM ) . Attached to the N - acetylmuramic acid is a peptide chain of three to five amino acids . The peptide chain can be cross-linked to the peptide chain of another strand forming the 3D mesh - like layer . Peptidoglycan serves a structural role in the bacterial cell wall , giving structural strength , as well as counteracting the osmotic pressure of the cytoplasm . A common misconception is that peptidoglycan gives the cell its shape ; however , whereas peptidoglycan helps maintain the structural strength of the cell , it is actually the MreB protein that facilitates cell shape .

'' This view may be given credence by similarly Otter - themed place names in Scotland , and the resemblance of Flat Top to Beinn Dorain in the ancestral Ewing area of Argyll and Bute .

2521	Some automotive historians say that the term originated with stolen vehicles being refitted with another engine and repainted . In the early days of automobile manufacturing there was no identical matching transmission , body frame , and engine numbers . It was possible to change engines and repaint the car or truck and in effect turn it into a different vehicle and thus it became near impossible to prove that the vehicle was stolen . The term `` hot '' was equivalent to being stolen . The term `` rod '' was equivalent to any motorized vehicle . Even today , the Ontario Ministry of the Environment in its vehicle emissions regulations , refers to a `` hotrod '' as any motorized vehicle that has a replacement engine differing from the factory original . Another possible origin includes replacement of the camshaft with a new ( `` hotter '' ) version , sometimes known as a hot stick or hot rod . Roadsters were the cars of choice because they were light , easy to modify , and inexpensive . The term became commonplace in the 1930s or 1940s as the name of a car that had been `` hopped up '' by modifying the engine for higher performance . A term common in the early days was `` gow job '' . This has fallen into disuse except with historians .	where did the term hot rod come from	ask_question

2561	However , although he is often connected with absolutism , Bodin held some moderate opinions on how government should in practice be carried out . He held that although the sovereign is not obliged to , it is advisable for him , as a practical expedient , to convene a senate from whom he can obtain advice , to delegate some power to magistrates for the practical administration of the law , and to use the Estates as a means of communicating with the people . Furthermore , he emphasized that a sovereign is bound to observe certain basic rules derived from the divine law , the law of nature or reason , and the law that is common to all nations ( jus gentium ) , as well as the fundamental laws of the state that determine who is the sovereign , who succeeds to sovereignty , and what limits the sovereign power . Thus , Bodin 's sovereign was restricted by the constitutional law of the state and by the higher law that was considered as binding upon every human being . Bodin believed that `` the most divine , most excellent , and the state form most proper to royalty is governed partly aristocratically and partly democratically '' . With his doctrine that sovereignty is conferred by divine law , Bodin predefined the scope of the divine right of kings .	four basic rules regarding the practice of sovereignty	ask_question

2565	Comte first described the epistemological perspective of positivism in The Course in Positive Philosophy , a series of texts published between 1830 and 1842 . These texts were followed by the 1848 work , A General View of Positivism ( published in English in 1865 ) . The first three volumes of the Course dealt chiefly with the physical sciences already in existence ( mathematics , astronomy , physics , chemistry , biology ) , whereas the latter two emphasised the inevitable coming of social science . Observing the circular dependence of theory and observation in science , and classifying the sciences in this way , Comte may be regarded as the first philosopher of science in the modern sense of the term . Comte was also the first to distinguish natural philosophy from science explicitly . For him , the physical sciences had necessarily to arrive first , before humanity could adequately channel its efforts into the most challenging and complex `` Queen science '' of human society itself . His work View of Positivism would therefore set out to define , in more detail , the empirical goals of sociological method .	who said sociology as queen of all sciences	ask_question

2567	The Dust Bowl , also known as the Dirty Thirties , was a period of severe dust storms that greatly damaged the ecology and agriculture of the American and Canadian prairies during the 1930s ; severe drought and a failure to apply dryland farming methods to prevent wind erosion ( the Aeolian processes ) caused the phenomenon . The drought came in three waves , 1934 , 1936 , and 1939 -- 1940 , but some regions of the high plains experienced drought conditions for as many as eight years . With insufficient understanding of the ecology of the plains , farmers had conducted extensive deep plowing of the virgin topsoil of the Great Plains during the previous decade ; this had displaced the native , deep - rooted grasses that normally trapped soil and moisture even during periods of drought and high winds . The rapid mechanization of farm equipment , especially small gasoline tractors , and widespread use of the combine harvester contributed to farmers ' decisions to convert arid grassland ( much of which received no more than 10 inches ( 250 mm ) of precipitation per year ) to cultivated cropland .	what were the two causes of the dust bowl	ask_question

2572	The practice of blessing someone who sneezes dates as far back as at least AD 77 , although it is far older than most specific explanations can account for . Some have offered an explanation suggesting that people once held the folk belief that a person 's soul could be thrown from their body when they sneezed , that sneezing otherwise opened the body to invasion by the Devil or evil spirits , or that sneezing was the body 's effort to force out an invading evil presence . In these cases , `` God bless you '' or `` bless you '' is used as a sort of shield against evil .

2592	Thermoregulation in organisms runs along a spectrum from endothermy to ectothermy . Endotherms create most of their heat via metabolic processes , and are colloquially referred to as warm - blooded . When the surrounding temperatures are cold , endotherms increase metabolic heat production to keep their body temperature constant , thus making the internal body temperature of an endotherm more or less independent of the temperature of the environment . One metabolic activity , in terms of generating heat , that endotherms are able to do is that they possess a larger number of mitochondria per cell than ectotherms , enabling them to generate more heat by increasing the rate at which they metabolize fats and sugars . Ectotherms use external sources of temperature to regulate their body temperatures . They are colloquially referred to as cold - blooded despite the fact that body temperatures often stay within the same temperature ranges as warm - blooded animals . Ectotherms are the opposite of endotherms when it comes to regulating internal temperatures . In ectotherms , the internal physiological sources of heat are of negligible importance ; the biggest factor that enables them to maintain adequate body temperatures is due to environmental influences . Living in areas that maintain a constant temperature throughout the year , like the tropics or the ocean , have enabled ectotherms to develop a wide range of behavioral mechanisms that enable them to respond to external temperatures , such as sun - bathing to increase body temperature , or seeking the cover of shade to lower body temperature .	describe how thermal regulation is different in ectotherms and endotherms	ask_question

2627	In nuclear physics , beta decay ( β - decay ) is a type of radioactive decay in which a beta ray ( fast energetic electron or positron ) and a neutrino are emitted from an atomic nucleus . For example , beta decay of a neutron transforms it into a proton by the emission of an electron , or conversely a proton is converted into a neutron by the emission of a positron ( positron emission ) , thus changing the nuclide type . Neither the beta particle nor its associated neutrino exist within the nucleus prior to beta decay , but are created in the decay process . By this process , unstable atoms obtain a more stable ratio of protons to neutrons . The probability of a nuclide decaying due to beta and other forms of decay is determined by its nuclear binding energy . The binding energies of all existing nuclides form what is called the nuclear band or valley of stability . For either electron or positron emission to be energetically possible , the energy release ( see below ) or Q value must be positive .	this type of nuclear decay effectively turns a proton into a neutron	ask_question

2659	Because Polaris lies nearly in a direct line with the axis of the Earth 's rotation `` above '' the North Pole -- the north celestial pole -- Polaris stands almost motionless in the sky , and all the stars of the northern sky appear to rotate around it . Therefore , it makes an excellent fixed point from which to draw measurements for celestial navigation and for astrometry . The moving of Polaris towards and , in the future , away from the celestial pole , is due to the precession of the equinoxes . The celestial pole will move away from α UMi after the 21st century , passing close by Gamma Cephei by about the 41st century , moving towards Deneb by about the 91st century . Historically , the celestial pole was close to Thuban around 2750 BC , and during classical antiquity it was closer to Kochab ( β UMi ) than to Polaris . It was about the same angular distance from β UMi as to α UMi by the end of late antiquity . The Greek navigator Pytheas in ca . 320 BC described the celestial pole as devoid of stars . However , as one of the brighter stars close to the celestial pole , Polaris was used for navigation at least from late antiquity , and described as ἀεί φανής ( aei phanēs ) `` always visible '' by Stobaeus ( 5th century ) , and it could reasonably be described as stella polaris from about the High Middle Ages .	where will you see polaris in north pole	ask_question
